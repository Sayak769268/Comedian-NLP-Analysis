        "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
        "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
        "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
        "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",

to get this shit over with cause i have to pee in  ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for coming  its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that  i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat  shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its  to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find out  i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books  fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was  the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost   and everybody thought it was  this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was  the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was  you never know when you might need this and i was  but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success i grew up a lot this past year  this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and  hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was  oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was  oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was  all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had  we had we had so much chemistry he was  hey wassup i was  wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was  hey can you drop me off i was  where he was  at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was  oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who   wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they  to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it  because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude  you feel  youre in a wes anderson movie or something and  white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff  voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff  that and its very  its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel  im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement  just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im  i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer  but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you  you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on  my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was  hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its  making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just  a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night  oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre  i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more  loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell  responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding  between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things  host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse   learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up  filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was  its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was  its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total  private school asians we both are big hippies too we  to backpack through southeast asia we  to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit  that  we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes  freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats  a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel  we are white people doing an impression of asian people  we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were  oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so  i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because  that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre  im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is  shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always  oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013  you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and  very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be  were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be  we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre  but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do  how much shittier food tastes when  you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be  look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im  that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day  youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically  wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre  oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks  its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to  squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want  its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was  you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently  and he was  hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was  why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes  mrs pacman just lets redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was   youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really  freaked out about anal and theyre  oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel  youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt  i got a second chance at life  i was  oh my god its  im going back in time \\u266a a whole new world \\u266a it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah  a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you

yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be  guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are  thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me  a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were  ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was  yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won  another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were  why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was  yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed  a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and  why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were  yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im  oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here  i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre  im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are  the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because  im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me  im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b  skittles so my uterus probably looked  a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act  everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich  mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were  oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was  only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be  were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its  release the kraken and they just come out  a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship  and  yeah and most of the time  we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be  ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look  they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be  hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre  oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was   yeah where im from thats  losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was  no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was  yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was  you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula  what that is  what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did  that youre gonna poop on the table i was  yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense  that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres  this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy  i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i  i berate my husband on  a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant  your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see  a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then  they get big\\u2013 they get big  fingers  you you you owe me money you my nipples look  whoppers now and naked i look  a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not  when i was  years old when it was  really hot  and i was  why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so  i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos  way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and  two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all right ive been ali wong have a good night everybody thank you your email address will not

winner whats the best way you can die this is not a trick question \\u2013 in your sleep \\u2013 yes thank you thank you everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep not me i want to be alert awake surrounded by friends in a house fire but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep we thought thats how she went we were all excited for her but then we did an autopsy found out she actually died horribly in the worst way possible during an autopsy it was fucked up yeah yeah she always said her grandkids didnt pay enough attention to her and and she was right she was dead on but i loved my grandma loved her very much my grandma taught me about a lot taught me what religion is taught me everything you can know about religion in one quick story ill tell you now when i graduated from high school when i graduated my grandma came to me gave me a big hug said anthony im so proud of you youre my first grandchild to get to go to college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college and i said honestly grandma all i need from you is money yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said  anthony i understand couple months go by its the end of summer im packing up my dads car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says anthony here before you leave take this and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said thanks grandma thats exactly what we talked about i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by im hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings its my grandma anthony just calling to see how college is going grandma college is the best im having the time of my life but to be honest im starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit  we talked about she said  well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said totally grandma im on chapter four she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later hung up the phone couple of months go by now im really starting to struggle financially might have to drop out of school so i call my grandma in a panic i say please its anthony im having the time of my life in college but if i wanna graduate and i do i need you to send me some money  we talked about she said anthony let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said yes grandma i wish it was longer and she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later finally its the end of the school year ive got straight as but im dropping out of college cause i have no more money left and im furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings its my grandma anthony i heard youre dropping out of school today how come and i said  goddamn well how come grandma cause you wouldnt give me any money she said anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmothers handwriting it said fuck you thank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write theyre all made up theyre all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else everything else is fake but everything im about to tell you from here until the end of the show thats all true now i dont tell dark jokes because im a comedian im a comedian because i tell dark jokes im kind of fucked up all right ive always been this way i cant really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends its ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyones funeral i asked a friend for advice was  ive never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and dont tell a joke try not to so i walked up and was   what my favorite memory was when i was  four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it  mark twain out of my grandmas mouth it would just come to life and then i couldnt help myself i said and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the n word now i promise you i promise you until youve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wifes funeral at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think im one of the best comedians of all time but heres the thing it doesnt matter if you believe me it really doesnt matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i  to test myself i  to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i  to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i dont believe in too soon im on a tight schedule and im good at it im good at it  the day of the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted other than that how was the movie right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff  that is im just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i dont follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying dont do it and whenever i see that whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened people will say anthony whats funny about aurora whats funny about the boston marathon whats funny about your grandmothers funeral nothing nothing is funny about those things thats where i come in so i see these texts and im  oh no what happened but i also think ive got a job to do so i go online i start reading about it i dont want to watch the footage but ill read about what happened and i think how can i make someone laugh today and then i think i got it i go back on twitter and i tweet guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed especially the finish line and again i think nailed it usa usa but then my phone starts to ring and its my boss or should i say my former boss and they say anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today youre also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or youre fired and i say go fuck yourselves and i meant it i didnt get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because im dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said sure they said well anthony you dont understand you dont understand at all if you dont take this joke down right now if you dont delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people theyre also out of a job and im ashamed to tell you this im embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke cause im happy to fight for what i believe in im happy to take the consequences for what ive done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet couldnt do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now ill tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in im just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture theyre  anthony were family why are you so upset cant you see we did you a favor dont you worry about your career let me ask you san francisco do i seem  i worry about my career no  why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if theyre worried about their money they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place i do not worry about my career and they said anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems  youre making fun of the victims and thats wrong but thats not what im doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me im wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking hey are we trending no this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston do  what thats worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying dont forget about me today dont forget about me lots of crazy distractions in the news but dont forget how sad i am those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of theyre  a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it its fine its embarrassing but its fun you can laugh at yourself its not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me thats fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess thats what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called shark party all right now some of you enjoyed it but if youve never seen shark party you can never see shark party its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack im  fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say  what i want to have a shark party as soon as theres a shark attack were having a shark party and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do ive already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark its time for a shark party lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television smile you son of a bitch shark party and in america where im famous for those types of shenanigans everybody was  anthony that was fucked up it was fucked up to see you dance end of controversy however in new zealand where they dont get my show theyve never seen me and frankly they dont get out much the new zealand media takes the video and they show it to the guys family and they say what do you guys think about this and they say crikey or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all  of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i dont read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and theyre  weve got some terrible news please sit down they say you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of shark party and i was  really new zealand wants to kill me thats weird because they didnt even kill the shark i said how many death threats am i getting and they were  oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want i said no forget about it leave it alone dont worry this might be hard for some to understand ive said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us dont get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend im a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said come on then my security guys are   anthony well just so  that is the dumbest thing weve ever heard but youre the boss  and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didnt care yesterday but its gotten much worse youre gonna wanna hear this they say someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dads phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harms way for something ive done or ive joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made even better this man is fantastici watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is  but a joke about a famous musicians son falling to his death isnt  where are your

my age who have kids and they all look  shit  its gotten to the point where i cant even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my instagram too much with their fucking haggard faces just drooping wrinkly crowsfeetembedded heads receding hairlines just withering graying hair coming out in clumps because of their children  i did a show and someone i went to high school with in singapore came to the show and after the show i met up with them and they brought another person with them and i was  oh is this other person your mom thank you so much for bringing your mother to my show and that other person was also someone i went to high school with  thats how fucking ugly  these people have become because of their children just unrecognizable so im

the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks zero medical training i was given no medical training whatsoever the government lets you do this the the doctor asked me to do it the doctor was  hey have you ever held a needle before no perfect here take this and inject your wife in the middle of her body  nicolas cage in the rock  twice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you mystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes just trust us that its the right thing that youre injecting into the person you love the most internet chemicals that show up it

wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely then you have to  the air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements and then you have to put it in the syringe then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude   what youre doing   i dont know what im doing i saw someone do this on doogie howser   i dont even know the angle to put it into her   it looks so painful going in  i love my wife so much i cant even bear to watch her in pain i couldnt even bear to watch the needle go into her i had to inject my wife  this i had to  cover my eyes and  backhand it  into her  kurosawa  did i get the middle of your body no  just walk into the needle  im supposed to do all the work here meet me halfway and  the doctor said if you do everything right if you measure correctly you inject at the right times they scan  this part of her body  that chicago bulls logo right and they were   if you do everything right based on what we can tell you should expect  eggs  and my wife ended up getting   yeah always a  yeah always  a late halfhearted response to  usually the women in the crowd are  whoo yeah all the men in the crowd are always   is that a good number is  a good number of eggs how many eggs equal one bebe is it four eggs is one bebe so  eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together let me put this in a language that men can understand  twentysix eggs from one vagina in one cycle is mvp numbers  twentysix eggs is  if magic johnson averaged the tripledouble and killed his own aids   thats the level of medical miracle thats happening in whatever this part of my wifes body that horn of the bull that  curls into itself the doctor  scraped out  eggs out of my wifes vagina  salmon roe just scooping out just dripping out and then you put it in some nigiri right and then you eat it thats how babies are made you gotta salt bae the eggs onto the ikura and then you eat it so  were trying to make embryos so eggs thats just half the equation i dont know if  how embryos are made but eggs thats just half of it she did her part admirably so now i have to contribute my half of the embryo equation so im sitting in the doctors office   a wet pigeon all right and the doctor comes over and the doctors a woman because of course she is shes  good morning mr chieng so  whens the last time you ejaculated my wife is right here and shes  yeah when is the last time you ejaculated  we would all  to know its the one time in life where youre not allowed to lie about jerking off its when a medical professional is asking you a direct question and its for reproduction its for the intended purpose so you gotta tell the truth so im  whatever ill tell the truth  let me check my calendar   i guess the last time i ejaculated was  let me see  yesterday around  pm  and my wife is  yesterday i was with you all day  and i was  yeah but remember when you took out the trash   because i also put up mvp numbers against a shot clock and heavy defensive pressure but i was thinking of you the whole time its really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever vietnamese people eat my wife is vietnamese ive no idea what the fuck she eats n\\u01b0\\u1edbc m\\u1eafm  and i went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off its the medical jerkingoff room every hospital has a medical jerkingoff room  its nondescript not a lot of signage smaller than i think it should be lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt and im sitting in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and theres grown men outside the door waiting for me to finish  so they too can use the medical jerkingoff room that we are sharing  a wework  and im in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and i couldnt go  sorry sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand im sorry sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me sorry sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters as they code to death painfully and the families crying in the waiting room wasnt turning me on  so i couldnt go i couldnt go so i just call  right im    im  these people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room  i call the doctor back in and im  doc i cant go  i cant medically ejaculate under these circumstances the vibes are off let me go home let me go home to medically ejaculate can i do that and the doctors  yeah you can go home but  as soon as it comes out of your body it expires quicker than avocados in hawaii  youve got  you have  a  window before theres  an exponential decreasing probability of  im   fine ill go home ill medically ejaculate ill come back in  minutes no problem so i go home open the front door ejaculate immediately  this is   this is home court advantage i know where everything is i know whats behind me i look at the dripping garbage bag  its  a pavlovian response at this point  i ejaculate into a cup  its a cup that they gave me its not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen  that says worlds best dad on it  its the cup that they use doctors give you to test your pee for drugs its got a really tight cap right so i ejaculate into the cup it keeps overflowing so i gotta keep  pouring it out  just overwhelming amounts  its  ghostbusters  up in here   i fill it to the brim and then i scrape off the top and then i and then i seal the cap as tight as i can right get it really nice and tight and then i i put it inside my tshirt next to my skin under my armpit nice and snug because the doctor told me to do that because apparently  the titanic your body heat will keep your people alive and then i run downstairs and i jump into a new york city taxi and im  take me to langone hospital please hurry up the taxi driver is  what the fuck are you doing with your hand are you  im  oh yeah no im fine no its not me its my my wife shes wait a person its my jizz  and new york city taxis have seen much worse so the taxi driver was  oh  cool thank you for using a cup  unlike the last two dudes who were back there just raw dogging at the jfk  what im saying and  we get to the we get to the hospital right i open the taxi door i run into the hospital and because its new york city someone on the sidewalk is  hey yo hey yo were you that guy in shangchi  am i yes i was a minor character in the marvel movie shangchi not the main guy and the guys  yo yo can i get a photo with you and im   sure  so we take a photo  this so

grateful he was  aw thanks so much man and i was  no problem man i shake his hand right  because i love meeting my fans and i run into the hospital right already hitting the  mark end of the fourth quarter theres no time left on the clock so i just take my jizz and i just throw a buzzerbeater right the doctor  catches my jizz    odell beckham she just  one hand grabs it and  in the same motion without even putting it down she  alleyoops my jizz into my wifes eggs right just takes it and she goes boom shakalaka and  my sperm goes into my wifes eggs and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg nobody knows its a mystery its a mystery of the universe nobody knows when sperm goes into the egg its unknowable ooh its its  the event horizon on a black hole no one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes nothing happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes it becomes a bubble tea  nobody knows where bubble tea comes from its tapioca the sperm goes into the egg and then you shake it and you go to vegas you throw it on the crap table and if youre lucky if you get a good dice roll right it becomes a blastocyst thats what we call future humans blastocysts it becomes embryos the doctor shell take all the embryos and shell look at them under the microscope and shell grade the embryos  cocaine  shell be  ooh yeah these ones these are agrade embryos right here   these ones these are these are bgrade embryos so so i dont know  these these ones these are cgrade embryos  oh and these ones yeah these these are these are dgrade embryos yeah these these will storm the capitol someday  so  you dont want that and then  and then you have to  draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics and you dont know youre just projecting data you just hope youre not throwing away a tom brady in the  round thats going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you cant measure the human spirit and  we all  to think were good people in this room but were all picking the agrade embryos  no one here is not picking your agrade embryos if given a choice even if you were a bgrade embryo  you would still pick your agrade embryos because youll be  i know what its  im not putting my kids through this bgrade human existence with sweaty palms and sciatica  give me the agrade shit give me the best we could do give my kid a fighting chance and it got me thinking about the future a little bit because i never wanted kids i never thought i would have kids the only thing i ever wanted to do my whole life was this standup comedy in america  its the best look at this its the best you are cheering because  this is way better than having kids   so much more fun and lucrative well the blastocysts are real now theres eight of them waiting for me in the cloud   chance of successful implantation with gradea embryos so i guess that makes me a mass murderer in alabama it got me thinking about the future what kind of parent am i gonna be am i gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were or am i gonna be better than my parents were be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck youre supposed to be now and thinking about it turns out im gonna be just as bad as my parents were i can i can feel it i can feel it inside me i can feel the i can feel the chinese inside me i can just feel that high expectation just low tolerance for excuses its in here its right in here its  the default app  you cant delete the calculator app theres no x when you shake it theres no x you can move it off the home screen but its still in the os embedded  in the operating system i can feel the chinese if my blastocyst was real if it entered this reality and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever oh my god look at this blastocyst everybody look look at how beautiful this blastocyst is i love you so much blastocyst i love you much more than i thought i would  and your blastocyst is hugging you back right theyre   i love you too daddy daddy daddy when i grow up i want to be a standup comedian just  you  i just feel the chinese coming on right i just  you take your glasses off  hitler in the bunker  standup comedy are you out of your fucking mind  thats not even a real job what do you think is gonna happen just gonna run around america and tell jokes to strangers who dont give a fuck about your mental health and even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds and make it to even a semiprofessional level as a standup comedian do you think theres any chance in hell youll be funnier than me    dad is a borderline arena act in some markets have you seen my imdb page im in everything i will fucking crush your career osoto gari your mother and i just spent a fortune to make an agrade blastocyst for them to become a bgrade comedian i will never watch anything you do go to law school   is what my father said to me  i do think its tough for straight men in  to sincerely look up selfimprovement on the internet without five weeks later storming the capitol  that mens selfhelp youtube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now  im not saying its the biggest problem in the world clearly but it is a problem  because men were genetically predisposed to seek selfimprovement  were trying to be better people every day believe it or not women  once we hit a certain age  usually we die before then through suicide or environmental factors bmx biking dietary choices but if you can live long enough as a man you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective  you start seeking guidance from outside sources you start looking at watches   every man in this room has or will at some point weve all been there guys weve all done this weve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives and weve been  what a fucking piece of shit  i fucking hate this loser look at this loser fuck this loser i hate this person i need to be a better person let me start by getting fit   let me work on my health that seems  a logical place to start my journey let me control what i can control in here so what do you do as a man you go on youtube right you look up how to lift weights right you press enter you click on the first video its some guy doing kettlebell swings right hell teach you how to lock your core so you dont break your fucking spine and then you do that for two days you feel pretty good about yourself  whoo right and on the third day the same youtube channel has a new video notification alert the men are  whats this new video from kettlebellswinging guy what could he be doing in his new video in the video the kettlebellswinging guy hes doing the new kettlebell exercise the lawnmower hes doing that and then   seconds into the video he just suddenly just stops and he looks really sad and he puts the kettlebell down and he looks straight into the camera and hes  yo guys just real talk for a second all right  kettlebells are great but i just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind  and all the men watching this are  yeah  yeah that makes sense that feels right in here tell me more kettlebellswinging guy  what other advice do you have for all areas of my life including my relationships and financial investments please give me guidance kettlebellswinging guy so what do you do you watch his next video on autoplay then you watch his next video here comes the youtube algorithm with a suggested video and here comes another suggested video and a week later jordan peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men  five weeks later youre storming the capitol dressed  a buffalo    thats a very realistic sequence of events by the way thats not even an exaggerated timeline every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm we all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that mens selfhelp andrew tate masculinity youtube selfhelp algorithm if you dont know anyone who lost their mind  youre the one who lost their mind youre currently in an echo chamber of assholes cause real friends tell you when youre losing your mind its very tragic all these men who are trying to be better people and theyre seeking guidance but that youtube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves theres tragedy in that  all those people they were just trying to lift weights  they werent trying to cause an insurrection they didnt even know what that word meant they were just trying to do this theyre trying to do this they didnt know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis\\u00e0vis their torso right is it  degrees or  degrees  is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you they googled it one time and then five weeks later youre taking a shit on nancy pelosis desk  and the us marshals are garnishing your wages because you take one wrong turn and life moves pretty quick im not saying as a man dont take responsibility for your own actions  im just saying that youtube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys it it sucks men in in a way that i dont think women understand it really preys on that mens need to seek guidance from somewhere its very hard to resist it just draws draws you in thats why fucking mark zuckerberg is trying to mma fight elon musk right now  that guy fell for his own algorithm do you understand mark zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd and for   years now hes just been looking at our data right jerking off every single day just looking at our data jerking off money piling up billions of dollars data jerking off money money jerking off data for  years that loop and who knew after two decades of that one day he just looked at so much data he was  oh shit oh shit he fell into it now hes trying to mmafight elon musk that guy jerked off and came on his own face   its out of control zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality and he invented that shit and he still fell for it what hope does the average man in america have just walking just waddling down the street looking looking for a taco on his phone hes gonna get sucked into his phone he has no chance that fucking guy has no chance because even the good guys in this room were all  on a razors edge to being a piece of shit   that margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razorthin i gotta tell you if you have the means every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge and  what an instagram post could push it either way   it depends on the post was it cute animals or was it boobs  thats gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours i do think as a society we need to  do a better job of identifying  when we have a disagreement with someone whos genuinely trying to have a goodfaith discussion to reach higher understanding and whos just talking shit we are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit and were not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics  for example me right now im just talking shit   this is oneway shittalking i dont care about any of your opinions do not send me any of them i do not care you paid for me i didnt pay a cent for any of you    free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shittalking session if you dont  it take it out on adam smith but if i was having a conversation with someone i disagree with in good faith i would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with thatd be a logical place to start a difficult conversation for example maga make america great again they have a point americas not doing so great right now right our kids math scores are down  our childrens science scores are down when judged according to international metrics  healthcare systems not doing so great wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially there was an implied promise to a generation of americans that if you do certain things work hard go to college be a good person you would have certain outcomes and those outcomes didnt materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decisionmaking positions lowered the capital gains tax  so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year in postworld war ii us leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for national security by making the us dollar the default international trade currency which gave america the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a us financial banking system but consequently increased the value of the us dollar astronomically which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in america  although the logic at the time  was that americans were supposed to upskill en masse away from the menial manufacturing jobs but everyone heres too much of a dumbass to stay school so we just traded domestic manufacturing to asia and the rest of the world at the expense of workingclass families but if you dont read enough  it comes out as lets go brandon  and its  you have a point but you dont have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didnt read enough you gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag theres a book behind the word you gotta keep going you can go at your own pace but you gotta finish the required reading otherwise we cant have a conversation were all catching up to each other im friends with maga im friends with the magas some of them are my good friends  whoo yeah hawaii maga  the friendliest of all maga  aloha maga theyre in hawaii right now making aloha great again i became friends with them because i filmed two seasons of a tv show in hawaii doogie

country i know you wanna die for your country but were losing the engineering jobs to asia right now so if you we need less people to die for their country we need more people to do their homework for

politics my maga friends and i out of mutual respect inevitably it comes up some stuff im wrong about some stuff theyre right about but sometimes  their messaging is so convoluted  i cant get to what their core issue actually is because their surface messaging is so chaotic  sometimes theyre  ronny china caused covid but covid isnt real  so is it fine then does it mean its fine i dont know how to feel about it now cause one minus one is zero i dont know what to tell you the the math analogy works for concepts not just numbers you can x is anything why are you yelling at me about china always

thats  the overriding directive that informs the entire decisionmaking tree robocop primary directive do not get scammed do not arrest ocp executive do not get scammed and for chinese baby boomers theres no value proposition  its just pure price sensitivity that means any money outgoing is a scam  if money leaves my possession that was a scam  so the whole time theyre just tensed up theyre just looking for scams when they go out theyre just  they cant even relax scams coming itll be a twodrink minimum over here parking guys tip  tensing up meanwhile koreans in the back just having fun  filipinos dancing  chinese baby boomers just tensed up the further they get from their house as distance x increases they know the fees will increase and so the ex the expenditures are gonna increase so they keep tensing up the further they get until eventually  their whole body tenses up into  a c right  a c for chinese  and then in the back youre  go go have fun have fun they just refuse to have fun  my mom came and visited me in new york city her only son she came to new york city new york city is the kind of city where as soon as you open your front door its    if you touch your door knob

youre embarrassing me in front of the hawaiians mahalo    these chinese baby boomers most scared of being scammed in real life the first to get scammed on the internet for people who live in fear their entire lives extremely gullible because these baby boomers they dont have the they dont have the antibodies to deal with the internet completely clueless when they go on now  watching baby boomers go on the internet now is  watching babies wandering into the kitchen by themselves just looking for cookies on the kitchen countertop just  running their hands blindly on the kitchen countertop pulling down knives kitchen knives coming straight down into their eyeballs into  the soft part of their skull they go in the kitchen they open the oven they turn it on they stick their head inside theyre  any pictures of my grandkids in here is this link safe to click on is this link safe to click on is this link safe to click on just falling for every basic bitch internet scam possible these fucking baby boomers tumbling into internet scams  pandas rolling down a hill  just jujitsurolling into scams every single day loving scams oh what do you want  target gift cards yeah sounds  a legitimate way to pay for antivirus software on my phone everybody look look at this link look theres a whats the one trick your doctor doesnt want you to know  ill click on that link i knew

on this these fucking internet idiot savants who cant remember a single goddamn password but for some reason can make any piece of misinformation go viral  a russian cyber army just spreading misinformation around the world in family group whatsapp chats everywhere everybody just look at this article is this real look at it is this real its how they factcheck they spread it look at this this is a real everybody weigh in im not saying a hair dryer in your mouth will kill covid  but what you cant ask questions anymore look at this article from cnnnnnru quick send it to your uncle send it to your send it to our whole family tree everybody needs to see this has there ever been a dumber generation of idiots more susceptible to fake news than these fucking baby boomers literally believing everything they see on the internet i get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last due to the exponential technology growth curve  but this has got to be the biggest gap in human history the information asymmetry right now is just out of control you literally have people in honolulu right now autodriving their tesla cybertrucks as they vape out the window and their phone ai is trading cryptocurrency meanwhile you have baby boomers they cant even rightclick  they cant even rightclick theres one button how do you rightclick on one button its scary they dont know whats real anymore hey ronny look at this photo of bigfoot shopping at whole foods  bigfoot is real now look theres an image of him buying kombucha at whole foods what technology exists that can fake images im  mom thats not real stop sending it around its not real how do  they always get so indignant about it  how do  that its not real how did  that because the font the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry and that lighting state doesnt make sense for that image and thats not standard dimensions for a news article i cant give you this knowledge its  malcolm gladwells blink ive seen so much shit on the internet my brain instantly filters it youll never have this skill set so just stay off the internet this world is not for you anymore stop making decisions  but anyway respect your elders  its a confucian value maybe if you give your mom some money she wouldnt get scammed so much yeah well think about the correlation between those two phenomena  people always ask me  why do you shit on your mom for money why dont you shit on your dad for money    no i dont talk about my dad because  my dad has no context for show business  we grew up in malaysia  his families are rubber tappers in malaysia my aunts and uncles are still in sitiawan in malaysia right now tapping rubber they have no context for show business very smart people but they dont know this world my dad he was the first guy in his family to get a college education he went to manchester college which has merged with the university of southern new hampshire he got his masters of economics there put himself through it very smart guy and he was a good immigrant he came to america to new hampshire to get his education and when he graduated he went back to malaysia he didnt take anyones job he left  and my dad had the vision to see what i didnt see he knew he had a ceiling on him because of the way he thinks and talks and he went back to malaysia and he was right for him he went back it was the right choice for him he became a very successful corporate executive  he retired to a farm in johor bahru malaysia love farming he retired to a farm thats how much this guy loved it but he had no context for show business so he wouldnt understand anything im doing  he wouldnt understand what im doing in godzilla vs kong hed be  why dont you just run that way  dad i dont control the edit  im just honolulu chinatown shopkeeper no  in this in this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla  im just connecting act  to act  i dont have a say in how this plays out because of that i stopped telling him about what i was doing i felt he wouldnt get it and he stopped asking me so i didnt tell him i got hired on the daily show he found out the way all parents find out about their kids accolades through a local newspaper so one day the local paper reported that i got hired on the daily show and he called me immediately he was  ronny whats this i hear about you joining the everyday show and i was  oh no its the daily show i joined  two years ago dad he was  oh  well whats the daily show im  its just  another latenight american talk show they kind of invented modern american satire and  and  my dad was  oh thats cool are you the host im  no im a correspondent he was  what is that whats a correspondent im  yeah correspondent is i help the host with comedy segments and he was  oh  hey mei hes just a sidekick  and so he had  no context for what was a win what was a milestone in this industry and so i stopped telling him and he stopped asking me and i didnt need that from him we we were totally fine wed talk about other stuff not about work we werent fighting it was all good  and he passed away very suddenly  in  he died on christmas eve died on his farm  no warning no explanation he just left one day he left so suddenly we had to go back to handle his estate if anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position when you have to handle someone elses estate it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life and so its me my wife my sister brotherinlaw went back to johor bahru and part of me trying to figure out his estate was i had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using so his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it and i opened it up and its passwordprotected and i know this guy so well im  his password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child so  i type in my sisters birthday and spot on spot on it was my sisters birthday  as it should be shes  an anesthesiologist in australia shes  way more respectable person than me actually saving lives  a good person contributing back to society not  this fucking asshole i get in  i get in trouble on the internet for shit i said two years ago every six weeks so it should be her she should be the favorite so i log into his computer i open his web browser i look at his browsing history and the whole time im  please dont let me find my dads porn please dont let me find what positions my dad was into even if it was just missionary i wouldnt be able to handle it im gonna have to burn this laptop for real chinese people when we burn things it goes to our ancestors and then my granddad is gonna see it and its  i dont i dont want that for them ill be fine but theyre gonna have an awkward time im considerate  that  so i open the web browser look at his history and way to go dad no porn what a cleancut guy no porn he only went on the internet twice a day  clockwork  am and  pm  the farmer that he was and every time he went on the internet hed only go to two websites each time so the first website hed go to was a local news website and the second website hed go to twice a day every single day was my twitter page  aw so hed be reloading my twitter page twice a day just to see what i was doing and i post stuff  hey honolulu hawaii i sold out five shows  this week whys there so many homeless people here id post stuff  that  and  he would read that and then hed be  i assume hed be  oh ronnys doing  hes in hawaii he sold out some shows and oh i guess theres a lot of homeless people in hawaii  and  that was his quiet way of keeping up with me he never told me that and i never knew that and we never discussed it  which is a very nice sentiment unfortunately  as best as i can tell this is the last tweet my dad read of mine  so as best as i can tell forensically based on internet browsing timestamps the last tweet my dad read of mine and quite possibly the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm was me posting on twitter if youre a baby boomer on twitter i already know youre a fucking loser  now obviously this was not directed towards him i didnt even know he had twitter i didnt even know he knew what twitter was but i stand by the statement   and i know thats kind of a weird way to end the show but    if its any solace  this was his phone when he died  aw that was his  wallpaper and his screensaver and  and i didnt even know and its a photo of me and my wife and were in hawaii and im wearing two leis cause my mom threw one off and i put it on  and  i didnt know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper  and   i i  to i  to think that  that is the last image he saw of me thats what he remembered me by when he left and  i also would  to tell my sister i won  i won it was me it was me you guys have been great

to get this shit over with cause i have to pee in  ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for coming  its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that  i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat  shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its  to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find out  i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books  fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was  the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost   and everybody thought it was  this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was  the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was  you never know when you might need this and i was  but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success i grew up a lot this past year  this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and  hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was  oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was  oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was  all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had  we had we had so much chemistry he was  hey wassup i was  wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was  hey can you drop me off i was  where he was  at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was  oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who   wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they  to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it  because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude  you feel  youre in a wes anderson movie or something and  white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff  voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff  that and its very  its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel  im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement  just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im  i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer  but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you  you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on  my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was  hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its  making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just  a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night  oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre  i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more  loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell  responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding  between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things  host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse   learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up  filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was  its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was  its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total  private school asians we both are big hippies too we  to backpack through southeast asia we  to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit  that  we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes  freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats  a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel  we are white people doing an impression of asian people  we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were  oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so  i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because  that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre  im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is  shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always  oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013  you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and  very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be  were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be  we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre  but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do  how much shittier food tastes when  you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be  look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im  that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day  youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically  wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre  oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks  its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to  squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want  its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was  you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently  and he was  hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was  why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes  mrs pacman just lets redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was   youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really  freaked out about anal and theyre  oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel  youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt  i got a second chance at life  i was  oh my god its  im going back in time \\u266a a whole new world \\u266a it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah  a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari  and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they  it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i  that fear that shit turns me on  especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye  hes discovered nirvana and its  youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim  my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right  i respect you right im  yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who  to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their\\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control   i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live  i just wanna be out of control for once just\\u2013 just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cunt im just waiting for the right moment to  become a housewife financially  i want my husband to get us to  a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when  youve made it when youre eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple  what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking  a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be  guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are  thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me  a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were  ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was  yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won  another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were  why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was  yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed  a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and  why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were  yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im  oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here  i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre  im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are  the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because  im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me  im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b  skittles so my uterus probably looked  a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act  everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich  mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were  oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was  only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be  were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its  release the kraken and they just come out  a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship  and  yeah and most of the time  we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be  ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look  they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be  hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre  oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was   yeah where im from thats  losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was  no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was  yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was  you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula  what that is  what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did  that youre gonna poop on the table i was  yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense  that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres  this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy  i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i  i berate my husband on  a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant  your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see  a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then  they get big\\u2013 they get big  fingers  you you you owe me money you my nipples look  whoppers now and naked i look  a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not  when i was  years old when it was  really hot  and i was  why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so  i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos  way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and  two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all right ive been ali wong have a good night everybody thank you your email address will not

it but i  it i  making hitler jokes its cool for me i enjoy it hell i lost my grandfather i lost my grandfather in the holocaust museum it was the holocaust museum of modern art which is just  a normal holocaust museum except you walk around all day being  oh i should have thought of that my grandmother died about a year ago and i didnt think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away but i was wrong it was fine the hard part the upsetting part was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted she wanted to die in the best way possible   you radio winner whats the best way you can die this is not a trick question \\u2013 in your sleep \\u2013 yes thank you thank you everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep not me i want to be alert awake surrounded by friends in a house fire but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep we thought thats how she went we were all excited for her but then we did an autopsy found out she actually died horribly in the worst way possible during an autopsy it was fucked up yeah yeah she always said her grandkids didnt pay enough attention to her and and she was right she was dead on but i loved my grandma loved her very much my grandma taught me about a lot taught me what religion is taught me everything you can know about religion in one quick story ill tell you now when i graduated from high school when i graduated my grandma came to me gave me a big hug said anthony im so proud of you youre my first grandchild to get to go to college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college and i said honestly grandma all i need from you is money yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said  anthony i understand couple months go by its the end of summer im packing up my dads car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says anthony here before you leave take this and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said thanks grandma thats exactly what we talked about i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by im hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings its my grandma anthony just calling to see how college is going grandma college is the best im having the time of my life but to be honest im starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit  we talked about she said  well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said totally grandma im on chapter four she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later hung up the phone couple of months go by now im really starting to struggle financially might have to drop out of school so i call my grandma in a panic i say please its anthony im having the time of my life in college but if i wanna graduate and i do i need you to send me some money  we talked about she said anthony let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said yes grandma i wish it was longer and she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later finally its the end of the school year ive got straight as but im dropping out of college cause i have no more money left and im furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings its my grandma anthony i heard youre dropping out of school today how come and i said  goddamn well how come grandma cause you wouldnt give me any money she said anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmothers handwriting it said fuck you thank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write theyre all made up theyre all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else everything else is fake but everything im about to tell you from here until the end of the show thats all true now i dont tell dark jokes because im a comedian im a comedian because i tell dark jokes im kind of fucked up all right ive always been this way i cant really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends its ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyones funeral i asked a friend for advice was  ive never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and dont tell a joke try not to so i walked up and was   what my favorite memory was when i was  four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it  mark twain out of my grandmas mouth it would just come to life and then i couldnt help myself i said and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the n word now i promise you i promise you until youve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wifes funeral at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think im one of the best comedians of all time but heres the thing it doesnt matter if you believe me it really doesnt matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i  to test myself i  to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i  to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i dont believe in too soon im on a tight schedule and im good at it im good at it  the day of the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted other than that how was the movie right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff  that is im just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i dont follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying dont do it and whenever i see that whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened people will say anthony whats funny about aurora whats funny about the boston marathon whats funny about your grandmothers funeral nothing nothing is funny about those things thats where i come in so i see these texts and im  oh no what happened but i also think ive got a job to do so i go online i start reading about it i dont want to watch the footage but ill read about what happened and i think how can i make someone laugh today and then i think i got it i go back on twitter and i tweet guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed especially the finish line and again i think nailed it usa usa but then my phone starts to ring and its my boss or should i say my former boss and they say anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today youre also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or youre fired and i say go fuck yourselves and i meant it i didnt get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because im dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said sure they said well anthony you dont understand you dont understand at all if you dont take this joke down right now if you dont delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people theyre also out of a job and im ashamed to tell you this im embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke cause im happy to fight for what i believe in im happy to take the consequences for what ive done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet couldnt do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now ill tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in im just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture theyre  anthony were family why are you so upset cant you see we did you a favor dont you worry about your career let me ask you san francisco do i seem  i worry about my career no  why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if theyre worried about their money they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place i do not worry about my career and they said anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems  youre making fun of the victims and thats wrong but thats not what im doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me im wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking hey are we trending no this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston do  what thats worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying dont forget about me today dont forget about me lots of crazy distractions in the news but dont forget how sad i am those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of theyre  a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it its fine its embarrassing but its fun you can laugh at yourself its not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me thats fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess thats what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called shark party all right now some of you enjoyed it but if youve never seen shark party you can never see shark party its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack im  fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say  what i want to have a shark party as soon as theres a shark attack were having a shark party and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do ive already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark its time for a shark party lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television smile you son of a bitch shark party and in america where im famous for those types of shenanigans everybody was  anthony that was fucked up it was fucked up to see you dance end of controversy however in new zealand where they dont get my show theyve never seen me and frankly they dont get out much the new zealand media takes the video and they show it to the guys family and they say what do you guys think about this and they say crikey or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all  of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i dont read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and theyre  weve got some terrible news please sit down they say you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of shark party and i was  really new zealand wants to kill me thats weird because they didnt even kill the shark i said how many death threats am i getting and they were  oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want i said no forget about it leave it alone dont worry this might be hard for some to understand ive said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us dont get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend im a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said come on then my security guys are   anthony well just so  that is the dumbest thing weve ever heard but youre the boss  and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didnt care yesterday but its gotten much worse youre gonna wanna hear this they say someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dads phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harms way for something ive done or ive joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made even better this man is fantastici watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is  but a joke about a famous musicians son falling to his death isnt  where are your

ladies and gentlemen make some noise for ronny chieng     thank you thank you hawaii im turning  so im harvesting my wifes eggs this year im harvesting my wifes eggs so that we can make embryos so we can freeze the embryos so that we do not have to have kids right now because kids are what you have when youve given up on your own hopes and dreams  im still trying here i look at my friends who are my age who have kids and they all look  shit  its gotten to the point where i cant even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my instagram too much with their fucking haggard faces just drooping wrinkly crowsfeetembedded heads receding hairlines just withering graying hair coming out in clumps because of their children  i did a show and someone i went to high school with in singapore came to the show and after the show i met up with them and they brought another person with them and i was  oh is this other person your mom thank you so much for bringing your mother to my show and that other person was also someone i went to high school with  thats how fucking ugly  these people have become because of their children just unrecognizable so im trying to use money and science to push the curve back a little bit and  first step of harvesting my wifes eggs is i have to inject my wife twice a day for two weeks so i have to inject my wife i am the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks zero medical training i was given no medical training whatsoever the government lets you do this the the doctor asked me to do it the doctor was  hey have you ever held a needle before no perfect here take this and inject your wife in the middle of her body  nicolas cage in the rock  twice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you mystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes just trust us that its the right thing that youre injecting into the person you love the most internet chemicals that show up it comes in a powder i have to make it into a liquid you understand its a meth lab in my kitchen as im mixing the comp im sweating the whole time cause im scared ill fuck up the measurements and kill my wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely then you have to  the air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements and then you have to put it in the syringe then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude   what youre doing   i dont know what im doing i saw someone do this on doogie howser   i dont even know the angle to put it into her   it looks so painful going in  i love my wife so much i cant even bear to watch her in pain i couldnt even bear to watch the needle go into her i had to inject my wife  this i had to  cover my eyes and  backhand it  into her  kurosawa  did i get the middle of your body no  just walk into the needle  im supposed to do all the work here meet me halfway and  the doctor said if you do everything right if you measure correctly you inject at the right times they scan  this part of her body  that chicago bulls logo right and they were   if you do everything right based on what we can tell you should expect  eggs  and my wife ended up getting   yeah always a  yeah always  a late halfhearted response to  usually the women in the crowd are  whoo yeah all the men in the crowd are always   is that a good number is  a good number of eggs how many eggs equal one bebe is it four eggs is one bebe so  eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together let me put this in a language that men can understand  twentysix eggs from one vagina in one cycle is mvp numbers  twentysix eggs is  if magic johnson averaged the tripledouble and killed his own aids   thats the level of medical miracle thats happening in whatever this part of my wifes body that horn of the bull that  curls into itself the doctor  scraped out  eggs out of my wifes vagina  salmon roe just scooping out just dripping out and then you put it in some nigiri right and then you eat it thats how babies are made you gotta salt bae the eggs onto the ikura and then you eat it so  were trying to make embryos so eggs thats just half the equation i dont know if  how embryos are made but eggs thats just half of it she did her part admirably so now i have to contribute my half of the embryo equation so im sitting in the doctors office   a wet pigeon all right and the doctor comes over and the doctors a woman because of course she is shes  good morning mr chieng so  whens the last time you ejaculated my wife is right here and shes  yeah when is the last time you ejaculated  we would all  to know its the one time in life where youre not allowed to lie about jerking off its when a medical professional is asking you a direct question and its for reproduction its for the intended purpose so you gotta tell the truth so im  whatever ill tell the truth  let me check my calendar   i guess the last time i ejaculated was  let me see  yesterday around  pm  and my wife is  yesterday i was with you all day  and i was  yeah but remember when you took out the trash   because i also put up mvp numbers against a shot clock and heavy defensive pressure but i was thinking of you the whole time its really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever vietnamese people eat my wife is vietnamese ive no idea what the fuck she eats n\\u01b0\\u1edbc m\\u1eafm  and i went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off its the medical jerkingoff room every hospital has a medical jerkingoff room  its nondescript not a lot of signage smaller than i think it should be lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt and im sitting in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and theres grown men outside the door waiting for me to finish  so they too can use the medical jerkingoff room that we are sharing  a wework  and im in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and i couldnt go  sorry sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand im sorry sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me sorry sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters as they code to death painfully and the families crying in the waiting room wasnt turning me on  so i couldnt go i couldnt go so i just call  right im    im  these people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room  i call the doctor back in and im  doc i cant go  i cant medically ejaculate under these circumstances the vibes are off let me go home let me go home to medically ejaculate can i do that and the doctors  yeah you can go home but  as soon as it comes out of your body it expires quicker than avocados in hawaii  youve got  you have  a  window before theres  an exponential decreasing probability of  im   fine ill go home ill medically ejaculate ill come back in  minutes no problem so i go home open the front door ejaculate immediately  this is   this is home court advantage i know where everything is i know whats behind me i look at the dripping garbage bag  its  a pavlovian response at this point  i ejaculate into a cup  its a cup that they gave me its not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen  that says worlds best dad on it  its the cup that they use doctors give you to test your pee for drugs its got a really tight cap right so i ejaculate into the cup it keeps overflowing so i gotta keep  pouring it out  just overwhelming amounts  its  ghostbusters  up in here   i fill it to the brim and then i scrape off the top and then i and then i seal the cap as tight as i can right get it really nice and tight and then i i put it inside my tshirt next to my skin under my armpit nice and snug because the doctor told me to do that because apparently  the titanic your body heat will keep your people alive and then i run downstairs and i jump into a new york city taxi and im  take me to langone hospital please hurry up the taxi driver is  what the fuck are you doing with your hand are you  im  oh yeah no im fine no its not me its my my wife shes wait a person its my jizz  and new york city taxis have seen much worse so the taxi driver was  oh  cool thank you for using a cup  unlike the last two dudes who were back there just raw dogging at the jfk  what im saying and  we get to the we get to the hospital right i open the taxi door i run into the hospital and because its new york city someone on the sidewalk is  hey yo hey yo were you that guy in shangchi  am i yes i was a minor character in the marvel movie shangchi not the main guy and the guys  yo yo can i get a photo with you and im   sure  so we take a photo  this so someone on the internet has a photo of me and this stranger and im doing this  napoleon if you ever come across this photo just know i am holding my own jizz  so feel free to tag it  he was very grateful he was  aw thanks so much man and i was  no problem man i shake his hand right  because i love meeting my fans and i run into the hospital right already hitting the  mark end of the fourth quarter theres no time left on the clock so i just take my jizz and i just throw a buzzerbeater right the doctor  catches my jizz    odell beckham she just  one hand grabs it and  in the same motion without even putting it down she  alleyoops my jizz into my wifes eggs right just takes it and she goes boom shakalaka and  my sperm goes into my wifes eggs and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg nobody knows its a mystery its a mystery of the universe nobody knows when sperm goes into the egg its unknowable ooh its its  the event horizon on a black hole no one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes nothing happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes it becomes a bubble tea  nobody knows where bubble tea comes from its tapioca the sperm goes into the egg and then you shake it and you go to vegas you throw it on the crap table and if youre lucky if you get a good dice roll right it becomes a blastocyst thats what we call future humans blastocysts it becomes embryos the doctor shell take all the embryos and shell look at them under the microscope and shell grade the embryos  cocaine  shell be  ooh yeah these ones these are agrade embryos right here   these ones these are these are bgrade embryos so so i dont know  these these ones these are cgrade embryos  oh and these ones yeah these these are these are dgrade embryos yeah these these will storm the capitol someday  so  you dont want that and then  and then you have to  draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics and you dont know youre just projecting data you just hope youre not throwing away a tom brady in the  round thats going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you cant measure the human spirit and  we all  to think were good people in this room but were all picking the agrade embryos  no one here is not picking your agrade embryos if given a choice even if you were a bgrade embryo  you would still pick your agrade embryos because youll be  i know what its  im not putting my kids through this bgrade human existence with sweaty palms and sciatica  give me the agrade shit give me the best we could do give my kid a fighting chance and it got me thinking about the future a little bit because i never wanted kids i never thought i would have kids the only thing i ever wanted to do my whole life was this standup comedy in america  its the best look at this its the best you are cheering because  this is way better than having kids   so much more fun and lucrative well the blastocysts are real now theres eight of them waiting for me in the cloud   chance of successful implantation with gradea embryos so i guess that makes me a mass murderer in alabama it got me thinking about the future what kind of parent am i gonna be am i gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were or am i gonna be better than my parents were be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck youre supposed to be now and thinking about it turns out im gonna be just as bad as my parents were i can i can feel it i can feel it inside me i can feel the i can feel the chinese inside me i can just feel that high expectation just low tolerance for excuses its in here its right in here its  the default app  you cant delete the calculator app theres no x when you shake it theres no x you can move it off the home screen but its still in the os embedded  in the operating system i can feel the chinese if my blastocyst was real if it entered this reality and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever oh my god look at this blastocyst everybody look look at how beautiful this blastocyst is i love you so much blastocyst i love you much more than i thought i would  and your blastocyst is hugging you back right theyre   i love you too daddy daddy daddy when i grow up i want to be a standup comedian just  you  i just feel the chinese coming on right i just  you take your glasses off  hitler in the bunker  standup comedy are you out of your fucking mind  thats not even a real job what do you think is gonna happen just gonna run around america and tell jokes to strangers who dont give a fuck about your mental health and even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds and make it to even a semiprofessional level as a standup comedian do you think theres any chance in hell youll be funnier than me    dad is a borderline arena act in some markets have you seen my imdb page im in everything i will fucking crush your career osoto gari your mother and i just spent a fortune to make an agrade blastocyst for them to become a bgrade comedian i will never watch anything you do go to law school   is what my father said to me  i do think its tough for straight men in  to sincerely look up selfimprovement on the internet without five weeks later storming the capitol  that mens selfhelp youtube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now  im not saying its the biggest problem in the world clearly but it is a problem  because men were genetically predisposed to seek selfimprovement  were trying to be better people every day believe it or not women  once we hit a certain age  usually we die before then through suicide or environmental factors bmx biking dietary choices but if you can live long enough as a man you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective  you start seeking guidance from outside sources you start looking at watches   every man in this room has or will at some point weve all been there guys weve all done this weve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives and weve been  what a fucking piece of shit  i fucking hate this loser look at this loser fuck this loser i hate this person i need to be a better person let me start by getting fit   let me work on my health that seems  a logical place to start my journey let me control what i can control in here so what do you do as a man you go on youtube right you look up how to lift weights right you press enter you click on the first video its some guy doing kettlebell swings right hell teach you how to lock your core so you dont break your fucking spine and then you do that for two days you feel pretty good about yourself  whoo right and on the third day the same youtube channel has a new video notification alert the men are  whats this new video from kettlebellswinging guy what could he be doing in his new video in the video the kettlebellswinging guy hes doing the new kettlebell exercise the lawnmower hes doing that and then   seconds into the video he just suddenly just stops and he looks really sad and he puts the kettlebell down and he looks straight into the camera and hes  yo guys just real talk for a second all right  kettlebells are great but i just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind  and all the men watching this are  yeah  yeah that makes sense that feels right in here tell me more kettlebellswinging guy  what other advice do you have for all areas of my life including my relationships and financial investments please give me guidance kettlebellswinging guy so what do you do you watch his next video on autoplay then you watch his next video here comes the youtube algorithm with a suggested video and here comes another suggested video and a week later jordan peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men  five weeks later youre storming the capitol dressed  a buffalo    thats a very realistic sequence of events by the way thats not even an exaggerated timeline every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm we all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that mens selfhelp andrew tate masculinity youtube selfhelp algorithm if you dont know anyone who lost their mind  youre the one who lost their mind youre currently in an echo chamber of assholes cause real friends tell you when youre losing your mind its very tragic all these men who are trying to be better people and theyre seeking guidance but that youtube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves theres tragedy in that  all those people they were just trying to lift weights  they werent trying to cause an insurrection they didnt even know what that word meant they were just trying to do this theyre trying to do this they didnt know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis\\u00e0vis their torso right is it  degrees or  degrees  is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you they googled it one time and then five weeks later youre taking a shit on nancy pelosis desk  and the us marshals are garnishing your wages because you take one wrong turn and life moves pretty quick im not saying as a man dont take responsibility for your own actions  im just saying that youtube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys it it sucks men in in a way that i dont think women understand it really preys on that mens need to seek guidance from somewhere its very hard to resist it just draws draws you in thats why fucking mark zuckerberg is trying to mma fight elon musk right now  that guy fell for his own algorithm do you understand mark zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd and for   years now hes just been looking at our data right jerking off every single day just looking at our data jerking off money piling up billions of dollars data jerking off money money jerking off data for  years that loop and who knew after two decades of that one day he just looked at so much data he was  oh shit oh shit he fell into it now hes trying to mmafight elon musk that guy jerked off and came on his own face   its out of control zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality and he invented that shit and he still fell for it what hope does the average man in america have just walking just waddling down the street looking looking for a taco on his phone hes gonna get sucked into his phone he has no chance that fucking guy has no chance because even the good guys in this room were all  on a razors edge to being a piece of shit   that margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razorthin i gotta tell you if you have the means every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge and  what an instagram post could push it either way   it depends on the post was it cute animals or was it boobs  thats gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours i do think as a society we need to  do a better job of identifying  when we have a disagreement with someone whos genuinely trying to have a goodfaith discussion to reach higher understanding and whos just talking shit we are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit and were not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics  for example me right now im just talking shit   this is oneway shittalking i dont care about any of your opinions do not send me any of them i do not care you paid for me i didnt pay a cent for any of you    free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shittalking session if you dont  it take it out on adam smith but if i was having a conversation with someone i disagree with in good faith i would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with thatd be a logical place to start a difficult conversation for example maga make america great again they have a point americas not doing so great right now right our kids math scores are down  our childrens science scores are down when judged according to international metrics  healthcare systems not doing so great wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially there was an implied promise to a generation of americans that if you do certain things work hard go to college be a good person you would have certain outcomes and those outcomes didnt materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decisionmaking positions lowered the capital gains tax  so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year in postworld war ii us leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for national security by making the us dollar the default international trade currency which gave america the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a us financial banking system but consequently increased the value of the us dollar astronomically which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in america  although the logic at the time  was that americans were supposed to upskill en masse away from the menial manufacturing jobs but everyone heres too much of a dumbass to stay school so we just traded domestic manufacturing to asia and the rest of the world at the expense of workingclass families but if you dont read enough  it comes out as lets go brandon  and its  you have a point but you dont have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didnt read enough you gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag theres a book behind the word you gotta keep going you can go at your own pace but you gotta finish the required reading otherwise we cant have a conversation were all catching up to each other im friends with maga im friends with the magas some of them are my good friends  whoo yeah hawaii maga  the friendliest of all maga  aloha maga theyre in hawaii right now making aloha great again i became friends with them because i filmed two seasons of a tv show in hawaii doogie kame\\u0101loha on disney   maga hawaii welcomed me into their homes ronny please come over please were having a barbecue wed love you to meet the family meet the ohana please wed love to have you over so gracious you show up theyre so warm and welcoming thanks for coming take whatever you want theres some kalua pork theres some loco mocos hot dogs hey here here touch my gun  touch it just touch just take it im always  i i dont want to touch any of these guns  i dont know where theyve been i dont know where theyre going i dont have time in my schedule to attend depositions  just give me the loco moco  very passionate people my maga friends and i respect their passion to some extent i do theyre  i love america i would die for this country and i believe them i believe they love america and i believe they would die for this country which is very admirable but its  man you are willing to die for your country why arent you willing to learn math  also for your country   do both for your country i know you wanna die for your country but were losing the engineering jobs to asia right now so if you we need less people to die for their country we need more people to do their homework for their country  do your homework for your country  actually sit down and show the work and  do the thats a more efficient way to show your patriotism if you take that i want to die energy and you put it into homework you will fucking top the school im telling you its skys the limit  dude youll youll solve a lot of problems youll create a lot of jobs youll increase the gdp just do do your homework for your country id rather die  i i thought so i thought that might be i thought that might be the case dyings easy math is hard  these quadratic equations making me suicidal  we try not to talk about politics my maga friends and i out of mutual respect inevitably it comes up some stuff im wrong about some stuff theyre right about but sometimes  their messaging is so convoluted  i cant get to what their core issue actually is because their surface messaging is so chaotic  sometimes theyre  ronny china caused covid but covid isnt real  so is it fine then does it mean its fine i dont know how to feel about it now cause one minus one is zero i dont know what to tell you the the math analogy works for concepts not just numbers you can x is anything why are you yelling at me about china always yelling at me about china china is doing this china did a weather balloon with a camera chinas got an artificial island in the pacific doubling as an aircraft carrier base chinas doing tiktok why is

you guys see that that was us  that was us were the lose the plane people  were not the human rights whatever i dont know tiktok i dont know what that is  were the  ah where is it where the fuck is it thats us  my my maga friends all hate us tax thats  a universal party platform theres different types of maga right theres  maga light maga concentrated but  right its unfair to group them under one banner but one uniting party principle is love america fuck us tax and i get it i also hate us tax now that im in the highest bracket  yeah im maga with that fuck us tax yeah fuck american tax feels good to say it  the words give you power right fuck us tax fuck american tax you  it you  it when i say it when this fucking foreigner says it you  that fuck us tax you  that you  it when this accent

consider this concept in a vacuum just as an academic exercise  when you love something you give it money  right  thats one of the primary ways we show love for individuals organizations ideas on

every once in a while probably tore stuff giving birth to you cut her a piece of the pie arbitrarily even just give a im sure your mother would appreciate it no matter who your mom is how selfaccomplished she is im sure your mom could use it fix the driveway invest in infrastructure something  sometimes americans treat their country the way they treat their parents  yeah  i love my mom i love my mom i would die for my mom but fuck her she made her choices  i love being in america i do i love being here i had my options i came here i love being in america because this is the country

money just comes into  fuck the president hes too old fuck this president the money comes in money just comes in  printing money i do this in malaysia same same words same same clothing same haircut facing the same direction in malaysia jail   the arbitrage value is out of control same product in different loc obviously ill do this here why the fuck would i do it anywhere else its the best i

their entire lives extremely gullible because these baby boomers they dont have the they dont have the antibodies to deal with the internet completely clueless when they go on now  watching baby boomers go on the internet now is  watching babies wandering into the kitchen by themselves just looking for cookies on the kitchen countertop just  running their hands blindly on the kitchen countertop pulling down knives kitchen knives coming straight down into their eyeballs into  the soft part of their skull they go in the kitchen they open the oven they turn it on they stick their head inside theyre  any pictures of my grandkids in here is this link safe to click on is this link safe to click on is this link safe to click on just falling for every basic bitch internet scam

misinformation around the world in family group whatsapp chats everywhere everybody just look at this article is this real look at it is this real its how they factcheck they spread it look at this this is a real everybody weigh in im not saying a hair dryer in your mouth will kill covid  but what you cant ask questions anymore look at this article from cnnnnnru quick send it to your uncle send it to your send it to our whole family tree everybody needs to see this has there ever been a dumber generation of idiots more susceptible to fake news than these fucking baby boomers literally believing everything they see on the internet i get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last due to the exponential technology growth curve  but this has got to be the biggest gap in human history the information asymmetry right now is just out of control you literally have people in honolulu right now autodriving their tesla cybertrucks as they vape out the window and their phone ai is trading cryptocurrency meanwhile you have baby boomers they cant even rightclick  they cant even rightclick theres one button how do you rightclick on one button its scary they dont know whats real anymore hey ronny look at this photo of bigfoot shopping at whole foods  bigfoot is real now look theres an image of him buying kombucha at whole foods what technology exists that can fake images im  mom thats not real stop sending it around its not real how do  they always get so indignant about it  how do  that its not real how did  that because the font the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry and that lighting state doesnt make sense for that image and thats not standard dimensions for a news article i cant give you this knowledge its  malcolm gladwells blink ive seen so much shit on the internet my brain instantly filters it youll never have this skill set so just stay off the internet this world is not for you anymore stop making decisions  but anyway respect your elders  its a confucian value maybe if you give your mom some money she wouldnt get scammed so much yeah well think about the correlation between those two phenomena  people always ask me  why do you shit on your mom for money why dont you shit on your dad for money    no i dont talk about my dad because  my dad has no context for show business  we grew up in malaysia  his families are rubber tappers in malaysia my aunts and uncles are still in sitiawan in malaysia right now tapping rubber they have no context for show business very smart people but they dont know this world my dad he was the first guy in his family to get a college education he went to manchester college which has merged with the university of southern new hampshire he got his masters of economics there put himself through it very smart guy and he was a good immigrant he came to america to new hampshire to get his education and when he graduated he went back to malaysia he didnt take anyones job he left  and my dad had the vision to see what i didnt see he knew he had a ceiling on him because of the way he thinks and talks and he went back to malaysia and he was right for him he went back it was the right choice for him he became a very successful corporate executive  he retired to a farm in johor bahru malaysia love farming he retired to a farm thats how much this guy loved it but he had no context for show business so he wouldnt understand anything im doing  he wouldnt understand what im doing in godzilla vs kong hed be  why dont you just run that way  dad i dont control the edit  im just honolulu chinatown shopkeeper no  in this in this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla  im just connecting act  to act  i dont have a say in how this plays out because of that i stopped telling him about what i was doing i felt he wouldnt get it and he stopped asking me so i didnt tell him i got hired on the daily show he found out the way all parents find out about their kids accolades through a local newspaper so one day the local paper reported that i got hired on the daily show and he called me immediately he was  ronny whats this i hear about you joining the everyday show and i was  oh no its the daily show i joined  two years ago dad he was  oh  well whats the daily show im  its just  another latenight american talk show they kind of invented modern american satire and  and  my dad was  oh thats cool are you the host im  no im a correspondent he was  what is that whats a correspondent im  yeah correspondent is i help the host with comedy segments and he was  oh  hey mei hes just a sidekick  and so he had  no context for what was a win what was a milestone in this industry and so i stopped telling him and he stopped asking me and i didnt need that from him we we were totally fine wed talk about other stuff not about work we werent fighting it was all good  and he passed away very suddenly  in  he died on christmas eve died on his farm  no warning no explanation he just left one day he left so suddenly we had to go back to handle his estate if anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position when you have to handle someone elses estate it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life and so its me my wife my sister brotherinlaw went back to johor bahru and part of me trying to figure out his estate was i had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using so his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it and i opened it up and its passwordprotected and i know this guy so well im  his password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child so  i type in my sisters birthday and spot on spot on it was my sisters birthday  as it should be shes  an anesthesiologist in australia shes  way more respectable person than me actually saving lives  a good person contributing back to society not  this fucking asshole i get in  i get in trouble on the internet for shit i said two years ago every six weeks so it should be her she should be the favorite so i log into his computer i open his web browser i look at his browsing history and the whole time im  please dont let me find my dads porn please dont let me find what positions my dad was into even if it was just missionary i wouldnt be able to handle it im gonna have to burn this laptop for real chinese people when we burn things it goes to our ancestors and then my granddad is gonna see it and its  i dont i dont want that for them ill be fine but theyre gonna have an awkward time im considerate  that  so i open the web browser look at his history and way to go dad no porn what a cleancut guy no porn he only went on the internet twice a day  clockwork  am and  pm  the farmer that he was and every time he went on the internet hed only go to two websites each time so the first website hed go to was a local news website and the second website hed go to twice a day every single day was my twitter page  aw so hed be reloading my twitter page twice a day just to see what i was doing and i post stuff  hey honolulu hawaii i sold out five shows  this week whys there so many homeless people here id post stuff  that  and  he would read that and then hed be  i assume hed be  oh ronnys doing  hes in hawaii he sold out some shows and oh i guess theres a lot of homeless people in hawaii  and  that was his quiet way of keeping up with me he never told me that and i never knew that and we never discussed it  which is a very nice sentiment unfortunately  as best as i can tell this is the last tweet my dad read of mine  so as best as i can tell forensically based on internet browsing timestamps the last tweet my dad read of mine and quite possibly the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm was me posting on twitter if youre a baby boomer on twitter i already know youre a fucking loser  now obviously this was not directed towards him i didnt even know he had twitter i didnt even know he knew what twitter was but i stand by the statement   and i know thats kind of a weird way to end the show but    if its any solace  this was his phone when he died  aw that was his  wallpaper and his screensaver and  and i didnt even know and its a photo of me and my wife and were in hawaii and im wearing two leis cause my mom threw one off and i put it on  and  i didnt know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper  and   i i  to i  to think that  that is the last image he saw of me thats what he remembered me by when he left and  i also would  to tell my sister i won  i won it was me it was me you guys have been great

to get this shit over with cause i have to pee in  ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for coming  its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that  i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat  shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through and then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its  to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find out  i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books  fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was  the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost   and everybody thought it was  this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was  the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was  you never know when you might need this and i was  but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success i grew up a lot this past year  this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and  hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was  oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was  oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was  all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had  we had we had so much chemistry he was  hey wassup i was  wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was  hey can you drop me off i was  where he was  at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was  oh no i just fucked a homeless dude again my husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who   wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they  to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it  because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude  you feel  youre in a wes anderson movie or something and  white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff  voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff  that and its very  its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel  im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement  just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im  i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer  but i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you  you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on  my last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was  hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its  making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just  a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night  oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre  i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more  loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell  responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes from i think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding  between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things  host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse   learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up  filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was  its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was  its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused i grew up going to private school too him and i are both total  private school asians we both are big hippies too we  to backpack through southeast asia we  to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit  that  we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes  freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats  a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel  we are white people doing an impression of asian people  we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were  oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house him and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so  i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because  that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre  im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is  shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always  oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i was people are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013  you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and  very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be  were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be  we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre  but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do  how much shittier food tastes when  you have to earn it a lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be  look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im  that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retired i do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day  youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically  wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre  oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks  its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to  squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want  its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was  you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together my fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently  and he was  hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was  why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes  mrs pacman just lets redecorate i gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to you i broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was   youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really  freaked out about anal and theyre  oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel  youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt  i got a second chance at life  i was  oh my god its  im going back in time \\u266a a whole new world \\u266a it was magical a big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah  a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari  and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they  it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i  that fear that shit turns me on  especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye  hes discovered nirvana and its  youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim  my husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right  i respect you right im  yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who  to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their\\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control   i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live  i just wanna be out of control for once just\\u2013 just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do it sheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cunt im just waiting for the right moment to  become a housewife financially  i want my husband to get us to  a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when  youve made it when youre eating mango that was sliced by a dude named noah i want noah mango rebecca kiwi danielle pineapple  what else i want i wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk see a quarter and just keep on walking  a princess i have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteran so i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be  guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are  thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me  a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were  ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was  yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won  another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were  why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was  yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed  a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and  why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were  yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im  oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here  i need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre  im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are  the tupac and biggie of longevity i also decided to have a kid because  im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me  im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbusters i dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b  skittles so my uterus probably looked  a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act  everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich  mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd when my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were  oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was  only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be  were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its  release the kraken and they just come out  a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship  and  yeah and most of the time  we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be  ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look  they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be  hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymore im very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre  oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was   yeah where im from thats  losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was  no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was  yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was  you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted im scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula  what that is  what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did  that youre gonna poop on the table i was  yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense  that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channel i can already see how theres  this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommy  i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i  i berate my husband on  a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant  your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see  a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then  they get big\\u2013 they get big  fingers  you you you owe me money you my nipples look  whoppers now and naked i look  a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it now that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not  when i was  years old when it was  really hot  and i was  why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporin so  i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos  way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and  two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnant all right ive been ali wong have a good night everybody thank you your email address will not

normal holocaust museum except you walk around all day being  oh i should have thought of that my grandmother died about a year ago and i didnt think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away but i was wrong it was fine the hard part the upsetting part was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted she wanted to die in the best way possible   you radio winner whats the best way you can die this is not a trick question \\u2013 in your sleep \\u2013 yes thank you thank you everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep not me i want to be alert awake surrounded by friends in a house fire but my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep we thought thats how she went we were all excited for her but then we did an autopsy found out she actually died horribly in the worst way possible during an autopsy it was fucked up yeah yeah she always said her grandkids didnt pay enough attention to her and and she was right she was dead on but i loved my grandma loved her very much my grandma taught me about a lot taught me what religion is taught me everything you can know about religion in one quick story ill tell you now when i graduated from high school when i graduated my grandma came to me gave me a big hug said anthony im so proud of you youre my first grandchild to get to go to college what can i do for you what can i give you before you go to college and i said honestly grandma all i need from you is money yeah i know you guys have never been but college is expensive and my grandma said  anthony i understand couple months go by its the end of summer im packing up my dads car getting ready to go to school and my grandma walks up says anthony here before you leave take this and she handed me a brandnew bible king james version and i said thanks grandma thats exactly what we talked about i got in the car and i went off to school couple of weeks go by im hanging out in my dorm room having a good time when the phone rings its my grandma anthony just calling to see how college is going grandma college is the best im having the time of my life but to be honest im starting to run low on money and i could use a little bit  we talked about she said  well let me ask you this have you been reading your bible and i said totally grandma im on chapter four she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later hung up

longer and she said  anthony i guess ill talk to you later finally its the end of the school year ive got straight as but im dropping out of college cause i have no more money left and im furious close to tears cleaning out my dorm room when the phone rings its my grandma anthony i heard youre dropping out of school today how come and i said  goddamn well how come grandma cause you wouldnt give me any money she said anthony let me ask you this did you read your bible and i just hung up the phone i was so pissed off took everything out of that room last thing i took off the shelf the last thing i took out of that room was that bible my grandma had given me took it off the shelf held it in my hands and for the first time i actually opened it up and on the very first page in my grandmothers handwriting it said fuck you thank you everyone i hope you enjoyed the jokes i prepared for you tonight and all the jokes i write theyre all made up theyre all fake except for eric clapton and the challenger everything else everything else is fake but everything im about to tell you from here until the end of the show thats all true now i dont tell dark jokes because im a comedian im a comedian because i tell dark jokes im kind of fucked up all right ive always been this way i cant really help myself it gets me into trouble a lot i lose friends its ruined relationships with people in my family for instance my grandmother actually did pass away about six months ago i did love her very much she was a big fan of mine and i was asked to speak at her funeral which was a horrible mistake horrible mistake no one should ever ask me to speak at anyones funeral i asked a friend for advice was  ive never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money how should i handle this anthony just go up there and tell a story find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody and dont tell a joke try not to so i walked up and was   what my favorite memory was when i was  four years old before i learned to read grandma would curl up with me on the couch she had this southern accent and she would read to me she would read mark twain to me and i loved it  mark twain out of my grandmas mouth it would just come to life and then i couldnt help myself i said and i know my grandma loved it too because it combined her two favorite things spending time with her grandchildren and using the n word now i promise you i promise you until youve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wifes funeral at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi you are not a real comedian i am a real comedian i am a pure comedian i think im one of the best comedians of all time but heres the thing it doesnt matter if you believe me it really doesnt matter the important thing is that i would pass a lie detector test i  to test myself i  to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but one of my favorite ways to test myself i  to joke about tragedies the day that they happen the day they happen i dont believe in too soon im on a tight schedule and im good at it im good at it  the day of the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shooting the day it happened i went online i went on twitter and i tweeted other than that how was the movie right right nailed it nailed it and the reason i get away with that the reason i get away with stuff  that is im just the guy who does it people are used to it from me it would be weird if i didnt make a joke the day of a tragedy which is why i was very surprised when i got in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now i dont follow the news regularly but i know the second a tragedy happens because i get  text messages saying dont do it and whenever i see that whenever i see that it makes me sad it makes me sad cause i know something horrible has happened people will say anthony whats funny about aurora whats funny about the boston marathon whats funny about your grandmothers funeral nothing nothing is funny about those things thats where i come in so i see these texts and im  oh no what happened but i also think ive got a job to do so i go online i start reading about it i dont want to watch the footage but ill read about what happened and i think how can i make someone laugh today and then i think i got it i go back on twitter and i tweet guys today there are just some lines that should not be crossed especially the finish line and again i think nailed it usa usa but then my phone starts to ring and its my boss or should i say my former boss and they say anthony this is unacceptable you are not just a comedian today youre also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or youre fired and i say go fuck yourselves and i meant it i didnt get into comedy for money or fame i know that sounds wrong because im dripping with both i only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do and they said sure they said well anthony you dont understand you dont understand at all if you dont take this joke down right now if you dont delete this joke right now not only are you fired but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people theyre also out of a job and im ashamed to tell you this im embarrassed to admit it but in that moment i folded and i deleted the joke cause im happy to fight for what i believe in im happy to take the consequences for what ive done but what i could not do cannot do is walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday i had this sweet tweet couldnt do it but as soon as i hit delete i got mad and i regretted it i would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now ill tell ya that and i got mad for betraying myself and everything i believe in im just as mad today as i was then just as mad so mad i had to have a meeting with the network where they called me in for a little lecture theyre  anthony were family why are you so upset cant you see we did you a favor dont you worry about your career let me ask you san francisco do i seem  i worry about my career no  why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt because if theyre worried about their money they wouldnt have played the lottery in the first fuckin place i do not worry about my career and they said anthony the problem is when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seems  youre making fun of the victims and thats wrong but thats not what im doing because you see the day of a tragedy victims are not on twitter am i wrong tell me im wrong the day of a tragedy victims have got victim shit to do no one is ever no one is ever putting on a tourniquet asking hey are we trending no this is who im making fun of when i make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social media facebook twitter whatever they got and they all write down the exact same thing my thoughts and prayers my thoughts and prayers with the people in aurora my thoughts and prayers with the families in boston do  what thats worth fucking nothing fucking less than nothing less than nothing you are not giving any of your time your money or even your compassion all you are doing all you are doing is saying dont forget about me today dont forget about me lots of crazy distractions in the news but dont forget how sad i am those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of theyre  a wedding photographer who only takes selfies you understand now im sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it its fine its embarrassing but its fun you can laugh at yourself its not a reason to stop telling jokes maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it trust me thats fun too you guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats well i guess thats what makes me me on my television show i once did a segment that aired once and only once before it was banned called shark party all right now some of you enjoyed it but if youve never seen shark party you can never see shark party its been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be so i will explain it to you i love sharks i love sharks more than anything people people i can barely fucking tolerate every single year  million sharks are killed by human beings every year   people killed by sharks so when i hear about a shark attack im  fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as i get this show where i can do what i want i say  what i want to have a shark party as soon as theres a shark attack were having a shark party and i get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eaten by a great white the champagne of sharks and i know exactly what to do ive already got the script written i walk on stage in front of the cameras i say ladies and gentlemen this guy from new zealand has been eaten by a great white shark its time for a shark party lights go down music comes up six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me and we all start dancing for way too long a stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance very tasteful and then i stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten which in retrospect is where it all went wrong but i get to say my favorite thing ive ever said on television smile you son of a bitch shark party and in america where im famous for those types of shenanigans everybody was  anthony that was fucked up it was fucked up to see you dance end of controversy however in new zealand where they dont get my show theyve never seen me and frankly they dont get out much the new zealand media takes the video and they show it to the guys family and they say what do you guys think about this and they say crikey or whatever the fuck they say over there the point is all of new zealand all of new zealand rises up against me all  of those cunts rise up and start threatening my life now i dont read the things that people write about me on the internet but i pay people who do and they come to me and theyre  weve got some terrible news please sit down they say you are getting a lot of death threats online from new zealand because of shark party and i was  really new zealand wants to kill me thats weird because they didnt even kill the shark i said how many death threats am i getting and they were  oh all of them you are getting all of the death threats what do you want us to do we can send someone to talk to them extra security what do you want i said no forget about it leave it alone dont worry this might be hard for some to understand ive said it several times tonight everyone is going to die i know full well i am going to die and most of us dont get to choose how we check out but if i die because someone murders me over one of my jokes best case scenario if somebody murders me over one of my jokes i immediately become a legend im a comedy god the mount rushmore of comedy is me four times i said come on then my security guys are   anthony well just so  that is the dumbest thing weve ever heard but youre the boss  and they leave and then the next day they come back and they say anthony sorry to bother you again i know you didnt care yesterday but its gotten much worse youre gonna wanna hear this they say someone from new zealand tracked down your mom and dads phone number and address in pittsburgh posted that online and now your entire family is getting death threats from new zealand and i have to admit that had never occurred to me before it never crossed my mind that my family my loved ones would ever pay the price be caught in harms way for something ive done or ive joked about and honestly i would cut my throat for my jokes i would give my life for what i do but if anyone and i mean this for a fact if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone i cared about because of a joke ive made even better this man is fantastici watched the show  times  and i laughed so much everytime except for the eric clapton joke and sharky party all is forgivable  great material so a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is  but a joke about a famous musicians son falling to his death isnt  where are your

ladies and gentlemen make some noise for ronny chieng     thank you thank you hawaii im turning  so im harvesting my wifes eggs this year im harvesting my wifes eggs so that we can make embryos so we can freeze the embryos so that we do not have to have kids right now because kids are what you have when youve given up on your own hopes and dreams  im still trying here i look at my friends who are my age who have kids and they all look  shit  its gotten to the point where i cant even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my instagram too much with their fucking haggard faces just drooping wrinkly crowsfeetembedded heads receding hairlines just withering graying hair coming out in clumps because of their children  i did a show and someone i went to high school with in singapore came to the show and after the show i met up with them and they brought another person with them and i was  oh is this other person your mom thank you so much for bringing your mother to my show and that other person was also someone i went to high school with  thats how fucking ugly  these people have become because of their children just unrecognizable so im trying to use money and science to push the curve back a little bit and  first step of harvesting my wifes eggs is i have to inject my wife twice a day for two weeks so i have to inject my wife i am the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks zero medical training i was given no medical training whatsoever the government lets you do this the the doctor asked me to do it the doctor was  hey have you ever held a needle before no perfect here take this and inject your wife in the middle of her body  nicolas cage in the rock  twice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you mystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes just trust us that its the right thing that youre injecting into the person you love the most internet chemicals that show up it comes in a powder i have to make it into a liquid you understand its a meth lab in my kitchen as im mixing the comp im sweating the whole time cause im scared ill fuck up the measurements and kill my wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely then you have to  the air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements and then you have to put it in the syringe then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude   what youre doing   i dont know what im doing i saw someone do this on doogie howser   i dont even know the angle to put it into her   it looks so painful going in  i love my wife so much i cant even bear to watch her in pain i couldnt even bear to watch the needle go into her i had to inject my wife  this i had to  cover my eyes and  backhand it  into her  kurosawa  did i get the middle of your body no  just walk into the needle  im supposed to do all the work here meet me halfway and  the doctor said if you do everything right if you measure correctly you inject at the right times they scan  this part of her body  that chicago bulls logo right and they were   if you do everything right based on what we can tell you should expect  eggs  and my wife ended up getting   yeah always a  yeah always  a late halfhearted response to  usually the women in the crowd are  whoo yeah all the men in the crowd are always   is that a good number is  a good number of eggs how many eggs equal one bebe is it four eggs is one bebe so  eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together let me put this in a language that men can understand  twentysix eggs from one vagina in one cycle is mvp numbers  twentysix eggs is  if magic johnson averaged the tripledouble and killed his own aids   thats the level of medical miracle thats happening in whatever this part of my wifes body that horn of the bull that  curls into itself the doctor  scraped out  eggs out of my wifes vagina  salmon roe just scooping out just dripping out and then you put it in some nigiri right and then you eat it thats how babies are made you gotta salt bae the eggs onto the ikura and then you eat it so  were trying to make embryos so eggs thats just half the equation i dont know if  how embryos are made but eggs thats just half of it she did her part admirably so now i have to contribute my half of the embryo equation so im sitting in the doctors office   a wet pigeon all right and the doctor comes over and the doctors a woman because of course she is shes  good morning mr chieng so  whens the last time you ejaculated my wife is right here and shes  yeah when is the last time you ejaculated  we would all  to know its the one time in life where youre not allowed to lie about jerking off its when a medical professional is asking you a direct question and its for reproduction its for the intended purpose so you gotta tell the truth so im  whatever ill tell the truth  let me check my calendar   i guess the last time i ejaculated was  let me see  yesterday around  pm  and my wife is  yesterday i was with you all day  and i was  yeah but remember when you took out the trash   because i also put up mvp numbers against a shot clock and heavy defensive pressure but i was thinking of you the whole time its really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever vietnamese people eat my wife is vietnamese ive no idea what the fuck she eats n\\u01b0\\u1edbc m\\u1eafm  and i went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off its the medical jerkingoff room every hospital has a medical jerkingoff room  its nondescript not a lot of signage smaller than i think it should be lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt and im sitting in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and theres grown men outside the door waiting for me to finish  so they too can use the medical jerkingoff room that we are sharing  a wework  and im in a medical jerkingoff room by myself and i couldnt go  sorry sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand im sorry sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me sorry sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters as they code to death painfully and the families crying in the waiting room wasnt turning me on  so i couldnt go i couldnt go so i just call  right im    im  these people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room  i call the doctor back in and im  doc i cant go  i cant medically ejaculate under these circumstances the vibes are off let me go home let me go home to medically ejaculate can i do that and the doctors  yeah you can go home but  as soon as it comes out of your body it expires quicker than avocados in hawaii  youve got  you have  a  window before theres  an exponential decreasing probability of  im   fine ill go home ill medically ejaculate ill come back in  minutes no problem so i go home open the front door ejaculate immediately  this is   this is home court advantage i know where everything is i know whats behind me i look at the dripping garbage bag  its  a pavlovian response at this point  i ejaculate into a cup  its a cup that they gave me its not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen  that says worlds best dad on it  its the cup that they use doctors give you to test your pee for drugs its got a really tight cap right so i ejaculate into the cup it keeps overflowing so i gotta keep  pouring it out  just overwhelming amounts  its  ghostbusters  up in here   i fill it to the brim and then i scrape off the top and then i and then i seal the cap as tight as i can right get it really nice and tight and then i i put it inside my tshirt next to my skin under my armpit nice and snug because the doctor told me to do that because apparently  the titanic your body heat will keep your people alive and then i run downstairs and i jump into a new york city taxi and im  take me to langone hospital please hurry up the taxi driver is  what the fuck are you doing with your hand are you  im  oh yeah no im fine no its not me its my my wife shes wait a person its my jizz  and new york city taxis have seen much worse so the taxi driver was  oh  cool thank you for using a cup  unlike the last two dudes who were back there just raw dogging at the jfk  what im saying and  we get to the we get to the hospital right i open the taxi door i run into the hospital and because its new york city someone on the sidewalk is  hey yo hey yo were you that guy in shangchi  am i yes i was a minor character in the marvel movie shangchi not the main guy and the guys  yo yo can i get a photo with you and im   sure  so we take a photo  this so someone on the internet has a photo of me and this stranger and im doing this  napoleon if you ever come across this photo just know i am holding my own jizz  so feel free to tag it  he was very grateful he was  aw thanks so much man and i was  no problem man i shake his hand right  because i love meeting my fans and i run into the hospital right already hitting the  mark end of the fourth quarter theres no time left on the clock so i just take my jizz and i just throw a buzzerbeater right the doctor  catches my jizz    odell beckham she just  one hand grabs it and  in the same motion without even putting it down she  alleyoops my jizz into my wifes eggs right just takes it and she goes boom shakalaka and  my sperm goes into my wifes eggs and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg nobody knows its a mystery its a mystery of the universe nobody knows when sperm goes into the egg its unknowable ooh its its  the event horizon on a black hole no one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes nothing happens when sperm goes into the egg sometimes it becomes a bubble tea  nobody knows where bubble tea comes from its tapioca the sperm goes into the egg and then you shake it and you go to vegas you throw it on the crap table and if youre lucky if you get a good dice roll right it becomes a blastocyst thats what we call future humans blastocysts it becomes embryos the doctor shell take all the embryos and shell look at them under the microscope and shell grade the embryos  cocaine  shell be  ooh yeah these ones these are agrade embryos right here   these ones these are these are bgrade embryos so so i dont know  these these ones these are cgrade embryos  oh and these ones yeah these these are these are dgrade embryos yeah these these will storm the capitol someday  so  you dont want that and then  and then you have to  draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics and you dont know youre just projecting data you just hope youre not throwing away a tom brady in the  round thats going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you cant measure the human spirit and  we all  to think were good people in this room but were all picking the agrade embryos  no one here is not picking your agrade embryos if given a choice even if you were a bgrade embryo  you would still pick your agrade embryos because youll be  i know what its  im not putting my kids through this bgrade human existence with sweaty palms and sciatica  give me the agrade shit give me the best we could do give my kid a fighting chance and it got me thinking about the future a little bit because i never wanted kids i never thought i would have kids the only thing i ever wanted to do my whole life was this standup comedy in america  its the best look at this its the best you are cheering because  this is way better than having kids   so much more fun and lucrative well the blastocysts are real now theres eight of them waiting for me in the cloud   chance of successful implantation with gradea embryos so i guess that makes me a mass murderer in alabama it got me thinking about the future what kind of parent am i gonna be am i gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were or am i gonna be better than my parents were be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck youre supposed to be now and thinking about it turns out im gonna be just as bad as my parents were i can i can feel it i can feel it inside me i can feel the i can feel the chinese inside me i can just feel that high expectation just low tolerance for excuses its in here its right in here its  the default app  you cant delete the calculator app theres no x when you shake it theres no x you can move it off the home screen but its still in the os embedded  in the operating system i can feel the chinese if my blastocyst was real if it entered this reality and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever oh my god look at this blastocyst everybody look look at how beautiful this blastocyst is i love you so much blastocyst i love you much more than i thought i would  and your blastocyst is hugging you back right theyre   i love you too daddy daddy daddy when i grow up i want to be a standup comedian just  you  i just feel the chinese coming on right i just  you take your glasses off  hitler in the bunker  standup comedy are you out of your fucking mind  thats not even a real job what do you think is gonna happen just gonna run around america and tell jokes to strangers who dont give a fuck about your mental health and even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds and make it to even a semiprofessional level as a standup comedian do you think theres any chance in hell youll be funnier than me    dad is a borderline arena act in some markets have you seen my imdb page im in everything i will fucking crush your career osoto gari your mother and i just spent a fortune to make an agrade blastocyst for them to become a bgrade comedian i will never watch anything you do go to law school   is what my father said to me  i do think its tough for straight men in  to sincerely look up selfimprovement on the internet without five weeks later storming the capitol  that mens selfhelp youtube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now  im not saying its the biggest problem in the world clearly but it is a problem  because men were genetically predisposed to seek selfimprovement  were trying to be better people every day believe it or not women  once we hit a certain age  usually we die before then through suicide or environmental factors bmx biking dietary choices but if you can live long enough as a man you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective  you start seeking guidance from outside sources you start looking at watches   every man in this room has or will at some point weve all been there guys weve all done this weve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives and weve been  what a fucking piece of shit  i fucking hate this loser look at this loser fuck this loser i hate this person i need to be a better person let me start by getting fit   let me work on my health that seems  a logical place to start my journey let me control what i can control in here so what do you do as a man you go on youtube right you look up how to lift weights right you press enter you click on the first video its some guy doing kettlebell swings right hell teach you how to lock your core so you dont break your fucking spine and then you do that for two days you feel pretty good about yourself  whoo right and on the third day the same youtube channel has a new video notification alert the men are  whats this new video from kettlebellswinging guy what could he be doing in his new video in the video the kettlebellswinging guy hes doing the new kettlebell exercise the lawnmower hes doing that and then   seconds into the video he just suddenly just stops and he looks really sad and he puts the kettlebell down and he looks straight into the camera and hes  yo guys just real talk for a second all right  kettlebells are great but i just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind  and all the men watching this are  yeah  yeah that makes sense that feels right in here tell me more kettlebellswinging guy  what other advice do you have for all areas of my life including my relationships and financial investments please give me guidance kettlebellswinging guy so what do you do you watch his next video on autoplay then you watch his next video here comes the youtube algorithm with a suggested video and here comes another suggested video and a week later jordan peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men  five weeks later youre storming the capitol dressed  a buffalo    thats a very realistic sequence of events by the way thats not even an exaggerated timeline every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm we all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that mens selfhelp andrew tate masculinity youtube selfhelp algorithm if you dont know anyone who lost their mind  youre the one who lost their mind youre currently in an echo chamber of assholes cause real friends tell you when youre losing your mind its very tragic all these men who are trying to be better people and theyre seeking guidance but that youtube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves theres tragedy in that  all those people they were just trying to lift weights  they werent trying to cause an insurrection they didnt even know what that word meant they were just trying to do this theyre trying to do this they didnt know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis\\u00e0vis their torso right is it  degrees or  degrees  is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you they googled it one time and then five weeks later youre taking a shit on nancy pelosis desk  and the us marshals are garnishing your wages because you take one wrong turn and life moves pretty quick im not saying as a man dont take responsibility for your own actions  im just saying that youtube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys it it sucks men in in a way that i dont think women understand it really preys on that mens need to seek guidance from somewhere its very hard to resist it just draws draws you in thats why fucking mark zuckerberg is trying to mma fight elon musk right now  that guy fell for his own algorithm do you understand mark zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd and for   years now hes just been looking at our data right jerking off every single day just looking at our data jerking off money piling up billions of dollars data jerking off money money jerking off data for  years that loop and who knew after two decades of that one day he just looked at so much data he was  oh shit oh shit he fell into it now hes trying to mmafight elon musk that guy jerked off and came on his own face   its out of control zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality and he invented that shit and he still fell for it what hope does the average man in america have just walking just waddling down the street looking looking for a taco on his phone hes gonna get sucked into his phone he has no chance that fucking guy has no chance because even the good guys in this room were all  on a razors edge to being a piece of shit   that margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razorthin i gotta tell you if you have the means every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge and  what an instagram post could push it either way   it depends on the post was it cute animals or was it boobs  thats gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours i do think as a society we need to  do a better job of identifying  when we have a disagreement with someone whos genuinely trying to have a goodfaith discussion to reach higher understanding and whos just talking shit we are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit and were not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics  for example me right now im just talking shit   this is oneway shittalking i dont care about any of your opinions do not send me any of them i do not care you paid for me i didnt pay a cent for any of you    free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shittalking session if you dont  it take it out on adam smith but if i was having a conversation with someone i disagree with in good faith i would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with thatd be a logical place to start a difficult conversation for example maga make america great again they have a point americas not doing so great right now right our kids math scores are down  our childrens science scores are down when judged according to international metrics  healthcare systems not doing so great wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially there was an implied promise to a generation of americans that if you do certain things work hard go to college be a good person you would have certain outcomes and those outcomes didnt materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decisionmaking positions lowered the capital gains tax  so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year in postworld war ii us leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for national security by making the us dollar the default international trade currency which gave america the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a us financial banking system but consequently increased the value of the us dollar astronomically which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in america  although the logic at the time  was that americans were supposed to upskill en masse away from the menial manufacturing jobs but everyone heres too much of a dumbass to stay school so we just traded domestic manufacturing to asia and the rest of the world at the expense of workingclass families but if you dont read enough  it comes out as lets go brandon  and its  you have a point but you dont have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didnt read enough you gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag theres a book behind the word you gotta keep going you can go at your own pace but you gotta finish the required reading otherwise we cant have a conversation were all catching up to each other im friends with maga im friends with the magas some of them are my good friends  whoo yeah hawaii maga  the friendliest of all maga  aloha maga theyre in hawaii right now making aloha great again i became friends with them because i filmed two seasons of a tv show in hawaii doogie kame\\u0101loha on disney   maga hawaii welcomed me into their homes ronny please come over please were having a barbecue wed love you to meet the family meet the ohana please wed love to have you over so gracious you show up theyre so warm and welcoming thanks for coming take whatever you want theres some kalua pork theres some loco mocos hot dogs hey here here touch my gun  touch it just touch just take it im always  i i dont want to touch any of these guns  i dont know where theyve been i dont know where theyre going i dont have time in my schedule to attend depositions  just give me the loco moco  very passionate people my maga friends and i respect their passion to some extent i do theyre  i love america i would die for this country and i believe them i believe they love america and i believe they would die for this country which is very admirable but its  man you are willing to die for your country why arent you willing to learn math  also for your country   do both for your country i know you wanna die for your country but were losing the engineering jobs to asia right now so if you we need less people to die for their country we need more people to do their homework for their country  do your homework for your country  actually sit down and show the work and  do the thats a more efficient way to show your patriotism if you take that i want to die energy and you put it into homework you will fucking top the school im telling you its skys the limit  dude youll youll solve a lot of problems youll create a lot of jobs youll increase the gdp just do do your homework for your country id rather die  i i thought so i thought that might be i thought that might be the case dyings easy math is hard  these quadratic equations making me suicidal  we try not to talk about politics my maga friends and i out of mutual respect inevitably it comes up some stuff im wrong about some stuff theyre right about but sometimes  their messaging is so convoluted  i cant get to what their core issue actually is because their surface messaging is so chaotic  sometimes theyre  ronny china caused covid but covid isnt real  so is it fine then does it mean its fine i dont know how to feel about it now cause one minus one is zero i dont know what to tell you the the math analogy works for concepts not just numbers you can x is anything why are you yelling at me about china always

thats us  my my maga friends all hate us tax thats  a universal party platform theres different types of maga right theres  maga light maga concentrated but  right its unfair to group them under one banner but one uniting party principle is love america fuck us tax and i get it i also hate us tax now that im in the highest bracket  yeah im maga with that fuck us tax yeah fuck american tax feels

consider this concept in a vacuum just as an academic exercise  when you love something you give it money  right  thats one of the primary ways we show love for individuals organizations ideas on

selfaccomplished she is im sure your mom could use it fix the driveway invest in infrastructure something  sometimes americans treat their country the way they treat their parents  yeah  i love my mom i love my mom i would die for my mom but fuck her she made her choices  i love being in america i do i love being here i had my options i came here i love being in america because this is the country

it to your send it to our whole family tree everybody needs to see this has there ever been a dumber generation of idiots more susceptible to fake news than these fucking baby boomers literally believing everything they see on the internet i get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last due to the exponential technology growth curve  but this has got to be the biggest gap in human history the information asymmetry right now is just out of control you literally have people in honolulu right now autodriving their tesla cybertrucks as they vape out the window and their phone ai is trading cryptocurrency meanwhile you have baby boomers they cant even rightclick  they cant even rightclick theres one button

kombucha at whole foods what technology exists that can fake images im  mom thats not real stop sending it around its not real how do  they always get so indignant about it  how do  that its not real how did  that because the font the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry and that lighting state doesnt make sense for that image and thats not standard dimensions for a news article i cant give you this knowledge its  malcolm gladwells blink ive seen so much shit on the internet my brain instantly filters it youll never have this skill set so just stay off the internet this world is not for you anymore stop making decisions  but anyway respect your elders  its a confucian value maybe if you give your mom some money she wouldnt get scammed so much yeah well think about the correlation between those two phenomena  people always ask me  why do you shit on your mom for money why dont you shit on your dad for money    no i dont talk about my dad because  my dad has no context for show business  we grew up in malaysia  his families are rubber tappers in malaysia my aunts and uncles are still in sitiawan in malaysia right now tapping rubber they have no context for show business very smart people but they dont know this world my dad he was the first guy in his family to get a college education he went to manchester college which has merged with the university of southern new hampshire he got his masters of economics there put himself through it very smart guy and he was a good immigrant he came to america to new hampshire to get his education and when he graduated he went back to malaysia he didnt take anyones job he left  and my dad had the vision to see what i didnt see he knew he had a ceiling on him because of the way he thinks and talks and he went back to malaysia and he was right for him he went back it was the right choice for him he became a very successful corporate executive  he retired to a farm in johor bahru malaysia love farming he retired to a farm thats how much this guy loved it but he had no context for show business so he wouldnt understand anything im doing  he wouldnt understand what im doing in godzilla vs kong hed be  why dont you just run that way  dad i dont control the edit  im just honolulu chinatown shopkeeper no  in this in this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla  im just connecting act  to act  i dont have a say in how this plays out because of that i stopped telling him about what i was doing i felt he wouldnt get it and he stopped asking me so i didnt tell him i got hired on the daily show he found out the way all parents find out about their kids accolades through a local newspaper so one day the local paper reported that i got hired on the daily show and he called me immediately he was  ronny whats this i hear about you joining the everyday show and i was  oh no its the daily show i joined  two years ago dad he was  oh  well whats the daily show im  its just  another latenight american talk show they kind of invented modern american satire and  and  my dad was  oh thats cool are you the host im  no im a correspondent he was  what is that whats a correspondent im  yeah correspondent is i help the host with comedy segments and he was  oh  hey mei hes just a sidekick  and so he had  no context for what was a win what was a milestone in this industry and so i stopped telling him and he stopped asking me and i didnt need that from him we we were totally fine wed talk about other stuff not about work we werent fighting it was all good  and he passed away very suddenly  in  he died on christmas eve died on his farm  no warning no explanation he just left one day he left so suddenly we had to go back to handle his estate if anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position when you have to handle someone elses estate it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life and so its me my wife my sister brotherinlaw went back to johor bahru and part of me trying to figure out his estate was i had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using so his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it and i opened it up and its passwordprotected and i know this guy so well im  his password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child so  i type in my sisters birthday and spot on spot on it was my sisters birthday  as it should be shes  an anesthesiologist in australia shes  way more respectable person than me actually saving lives  a good person contributing back to society not  this fucking asshole i get in  i get in trouble on the internet for shit i said two years ago every six weeks so it should be her she should be the favorite so i log into his computer i open his web browser i look at his browsing history and the whole time im  please dont let me find my dads porn please dont let me find what positions my dad was into even if it was just missionary i wouldnt be able to handle it im gonna have to burn this laptop for real chinese people when we burn things it goes to our ancestors and then my granddad is gonna see it and its  i dont i dont want that for them ill be fine but theyre gonna have an awkward time im considerate  that  so i open the web browser look at his history and way to go dad no porn what a cleancut guy no porn he only went on the internet twice a day  clockwork  am and  pm  the farmer that he was and every time he went on the internet hed only go to two websites each time so the first website hed go to was a local news website and the second website hed go to twice a day every single day was my twitter page  aw so hed be reloading my twitter page twice a day just to see what i was doing and i post stuff  hey honolulu hawaii i sold out five shows  this week whys there so many homeless people here id post stuff  that  and  he would read that and then hed be  i assume hed be  oh ronnys doing  hes in hawaii he sold out some shows and oh i guess theres a lot of homeless people in hawaii  and  that was his quiet way of keeping up with me he never told me that and i never knew that and we never discussed it  which is a very nice sentiment unfortunately  as best as i can tell this is the last tweet my dad read of mine  so as best as i can tell forensically based on internet browsing timestamps the last tweet my dad read of mine and quite possibly the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm was me posting on twitter if youre a baby boomer on twitter i already know youre a fucking loser  now obviously this was not directed towards him i didnt even know he had twitter i didnt even know he knew what twitter was but i stand by the statement   and i know thats kind of a weird way to end the show but    if its any solace  this was his phone when he died  aw that was his  wallpaper and his screensaver and  and i didnt even know and its a photo of me and my wife and were in hawaii and im wearing two leis cause my mom threw one off and i put it on  and  i didnt know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper  and   i i  to i  to think that  that is the last image he saw of me thats what he remembered me by when he left and  i also would  to tell my sister i won  i won it was me it was me you guys have been great

              " ['wow hey thank you thanks thank you guys hey seattle nice to see you look at this look at us were here this is crazy its insane so about five years ago pretty much everyone who i know started to get married and that was strange for me because i dont really believe in the idea of marriage and that would have been fine except i have a problem where sometimes when i think that i am right about something it can be a real source of tension between me and the person im arguing with and the reason its a source of tension is that im right and so i remember distinctly talking to my friend dana and she goes well you dont believe in marriage for you but of course you believe in it for other people and i was  no i think its insane  for anyone and she said whyand i said well first of all it just seems doomed   of marriages end in divorce thats just first marriages by the way second marriages  to  end in divorce third marriages  to  end in divorce thats a learning curvesecond of all monogamys impossible or at the very least not a sure thing when i say that i think people assume that im implying that men are incapable of being faithful i think women are just as incapable but for more sophisticated reasons  i mean with men were just really simple we have a very simple sexuality when i say that my female friends are  well we  sex just as much as you do and i said sure but its different and they say how and i say have you ever masturbated while driving a carnumber three im never gonna be happy why would anyone want to be a part of that i think thats not brought up often enough i  i didnt know that would be the reaction oh no thats the hopeful part the  i had one ally in all this which is my friend andy and hes a comedian as well not only did we decide we werent gonna get married we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married yeah we were pretty good at it  we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages  we were we were pretty good i mean we werent  the best in the world im sure there are better in europe but we were we were solid   so  for example at point my friend alex was about to get engaged and so we just took him to dinner and during dessert we gave him a long hard stare we said are you sure this is what you want to do and then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel  when we werent friends anymore so february   im at andys house in los angeles and earlier in the night i got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone and it was a bad one because i knew that i was right and andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation cause hes the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether youre right he says stuff  she sounds crazy  even if what shes saying isnt that crazy  youd be  she only eats whole wheat bagels hed be  she sounds crazy youd be  thats not even the crazy part  so im telling him about his argument and he goes youre right i go i know im right he goes yeah youre right i go i know im right i got to tell her about this in the morning and i get in my rental car to head back to my hotel and im driving out of andys small road and im tboned i dont know if youre familiar with this term  this is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car drivers side at a  angle  a tbone steak and in   seconds im spun around and i think im dead no wait im paralyzed and then i hear nothing and then i hear the other car skid out and drive away i know let me tell you how this argument started i met jenny in st louis my friend andy and i were working for her company they were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches which is really my demographic i  no i was very nervous about this i was actually kind of about to go onstage and i was  scrawling notes on my napkin a lot of times ill write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary and jenny looked at me and she goes what are you doing and i said im writing my set list and then she goes i think itll be fine and i was  no it wont be fine and then she was  i think it will be  and i said why do you think that and she said well you look so nervous i think theyll feel sorry for you but jenny has this really soft sweet voice  the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything at one point she said it seems  you comedians are a lot funnier onstage normally id be offended by that but in this instance i was  you are right that is a great point you are beautiful  she re she really was  from the moment i met jenny i knew i wanted to sleep with her at least once stay with me  i mean i mean that in  in the most meaningful way  that was the most that i was capable of in my life at that point i id jus id just come off a really long difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married and and then we werent and then when we werent i was so heartbroken i just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely  and but from the moment i met jenny i just wanted to be with her and i didnt i didnt think it was gonna happen  i dont have that kind of confidence i actually think of myself as a sex maybe which is to say that if im seeing a girl shed think id have sex with him maybe  and im im not ashamed of that there were periods in my life where i was a sex never or a sex with self always yeah and often surprisingly often yeah i just dont give off a great first impression  ill give you an example ',\n",

and the guy comes by with fried dough and im  next time  thats how i go for fried dough cause i have a problem i just this is ridiculous can you follow me over here for a second im gonna jump off stage this is only in seattle where someone is wearing no shoes no shoes or socks what who are you people what is wrong with you i would expect that behavior from this guy but not you sir not you what is this where do you think you are from seattle yeah seattle so ive been going  recently to a womens exercise class iive given up on having a traditional male physique and so now im going for strong independent woman and  its going pretty well  im not as good in the class as you might think sometimes ill kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isnt looking but then when she looks over i always have to strike a pose as though ive been doing what everybody else has been doing it reminds me of the olympics  how they do gymnastics how theyll have those the girls will do those crazy flips and twirls and every once in a while and im not saying i root for this to happen but sometimes theyll fall and its ugly cause theyre rolling around  im in a lot of trouble  i dont even know how i got here but at the end of that no matter what and i totally fall for it im  that cant possibly be the same loser from moments ago i mean thats a completely different person this person has much better posture for starters i really wanted jenny to come out with me and andy that night in st louis cause we were going out to one of these famous irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak and so i thought that might work to my advantage i dont know and  i didnt have the nerve to ask her myself and so i convinced andy to ask her for us and  pfft which yeah i dont know if that was the best idea cause  were heading were in the car heading to the pub and jenny says oh i left my id at the hotel and i was  oh we can just swing back and get it and shes  shes  no itll be fine i was  no it wont be fine cause its st patricks day and theres bouncers and she goes no itll be  and i was  no it wont be  and then we get to the pub and it was fine  the bouncer just kind of waved her through which has not been my experience with bouncers for me bouncers are  prison guards and for jenny theyre  birthday clowns   what can i do to make your day betteryou know and thats were at the pub and it had taken so much convincing for andy to get jenny to come out there by the time she came out she thought she was on a date with him and yeah that wasnt the idea and so i said i had to convince him to fall away as the night went on  the red rockets on the space shuttle and eventually she realized she was on a date with me and she was not happy about that but  but she warmed to me as the night went on cause she was drinking and then  no by the end of the night we were laughing and having a good time and we i caught a break which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends and she and i were stuffed in this little back seat together and it was really quiet so i could hear her soft voice and she told me she had just come off a long difficult breakup and i told her about my breakup and for a moment there in the back seat it felt  we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart and we get back to the hotel and i offer to walk her to her room and she says sure we get to her door and i didnt want this night to end and so i build up the courage to lean in to kiss her and she says oh no thank you which i thought was polite but disappointing i mean theres something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because youre really putting yourself out there youre just  i think we should connect mouths  and the other persons  i do not think we should connect mouths and those are theyre two very different mouth agendas  and then you just feel so stupid youre  i never should have suggested we connect mouths  this is a sore subject for me i have sort of a long history of failed kisses  i i remember growing up  when people started making out  in my time in massachusetts it was in seventh grade i remember i remember it  it was yesterday cause i was shocked i was  people we know are just making out with other people we know but how  it seemed  an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden i was  i am not doing that and collectively all the girls in my class were  that is fine you are not on the list youre not exactly a firstround draft pick for our new activity i was  perfect it seemed so gross to me and it still does kind of  sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from t',\n",
              "  'hese guys who are  i dont  when i see two dudes making out in the street and i feel that way about anyone  making out is just sloppy its  watching a dog eat spaghetti thats how i make out is that right does anybody know if thats right  good so in seventh grade i was  im not gonna make out with anybody and that was fine for a while but increasingly it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts it was  the makeout club and the nonmakeout club and these were informal organizations of course i mean i would be sad if that were schoolsanctioned  we call this meeting of the nonmakeout club to order first order of business nintendo second order of business why doesnt anyone  us meeting adjourned i dont know it was a sad group and we were losing good guys by the day i feared i feared that soon i would be the lone member of the nonmakeout club so i was  i got to try to get into the makeout club but it was a very intangible goal i didnt really talk to a lot of girls and there was one girl who sat in front of me in class named lisa bazetti who i had a huge crush on but she was way out of my league  she had many suitors she had i dont the rest of the show is in old english  she doth had many suitors  no she had many  admirers and there were three of us really and i was in third place in all the trade publications but i had one advantage over these other guys which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework thanks to alphabetical order bazetti birbiglia one time i said something on the phone that made her laugh and i was  oh this is great i got to do that more and one time we were on the phone and she was laughing so hard i remember so well cause she goes mike you got to stop im gonna pee myself and i was  wow this was the closest id ever come to a vagina so spent the next  years trying to get lisa bazetti to pee and thats how i ended up here yeah thats how we all ended up here in a sense so  so heres what happened with lisa one time i built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me and she said yes i couldnt believe it  all of a sudden i thought well maybe this will be  one of those romantic comedy montages well go to the carnival well get stuck on the top of the ferris wheel well make out itll all take a minute and a half and it will be set to phil collins song but i think that when youre  years old you just dont understand certain things about your digestive system you dont know that you shouldnt eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler cotton candy being the most insane of these items its basically saying were gonna take sugar which everyone knows is bad but then well dress it up  insulation and im  im not sure what the selling point is there is it the sugar or the insulation theyre  we already sold it im  well done way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates i dont know if you have the scrambler here in seattle i imagine you might it travels on a truck it is a very mobile scrambling unit the premise is very simple you just sit on a twoperson pod with the person you are in love with and that pod goes in a circle which is part of a larger circle which is part of an even grander circle as i understand it it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients it was called the shits of pantserator and it was wildly successful and then it was coopted by the carnival workers of america cwoa and they said they said we  it but we do feel  the name is a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy says well what about the i think im gonna dieerator and theyre  thats good cause it gets across the essence of how you feel when youre on the machine plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea which is a nice homage to the original intention of the machine but we still feel  the name might be a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy goes well what about the scrambler cause it scrambles you theyre  we get it frank but who frank is a maniac this guy cant be stopped but every once in a while hes got a good idea but who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment and this one guy goes well i have a nephew whos  years old and smokes pot  hours a day i feel  he might be available and theyre  he sounds amazing we dont even need to interview him he sounds completely qualifiedi sit down with lisa on the scrambler and im feeling good  shes snuggling up close to me and im thinking im thinking  this could be it this could be where its all gonna happen this is very special and then they put that bar seat belt down and the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment its not a ralph nader approved item i dont think its saved lives i think the only thing its ever done is in a scrambler accident its just sort of held someones esophagus down to the pavement making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident first rule of scrambler accident dont talk about scrambler accident thats from scrambler club well i knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that i was going to throw up for sure and i even said to the  stoner i was  hey actually and then he was gone apparently he doesnt enjoy the second halves of sentencesso then im scrambling and as i am scrambling im thinking i need to come up with a plan of some kind im not going down without a fight my first plan was very simple it was ju',\n",
              "  'st dont look at lisa dont look at any other people i was  dont look at lisa dont look at any other people dont look at lisa dont look at any other people i need a new plan and the new plan was i needed to tell the scrambler operator that he needed to stop the ride but the mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window so im  i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride i got to tell him hes got to stop the ride please stop the ride and im back im not sure he heard me i got to say it louder please stop the ride im not sure hes paying attention i think he might be smoking pot right now the third time i said please stop and then i started throwing up and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler just popcorn peanuts insulation really insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa i did not look at lisa but im pretty sure she was staring at me because i was a spectacle at that point i was spectacular and we did not make out i did not lose my mouth virginity that evening two years later it gets worse  im at the st johns high school what they call a cattle call dance this is an all boys catholic school i attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty st johns gymnasium  cattle which is a friendly way to describe women  so cattle shows up at  well make out with the cattle cattle goes home at  then we go out for burgers completely separate from the cattle analogy it was a horrible affair it was just  this room chockfull of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out at this point i was indeed the lone member of the nonmakeout club but it was actually worse than that cause i had to lie to my friends and tell them i had had my first kiss cause it was  this really tough all boys school and so when they would ask  oh have you had your first kiss id be  yeah  all the time  every every week i always feared at some point thered be a followup question  oh yeah whats it  and id be  yeah  its just  licking an ice cream cone and theyd be  no its not its  sucking on a rocket pop and id be  ah wrong frozen dessert analogy im at the dance and im flanked by my friend sam ricciardi and were introduced by our friend tom to these girls from his town they were the last two cows at the dance they were  moo and we were  moo and then sam says one of these phrases i think weve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat he says you get that one which i know its the worst turn of phrase but im comfortable saying it cause i know ive been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me you get that one and then her friend goes  oof  or even worse or even worse  you owe me which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance i would hate to hurt someones credit score  so he goes he goes you get that one and then im just fast dancing with this girl sandra to young mcs bust a move and im not great at fast dancing but they had the strobe light going so its only catching me one out of every five hey so shes losing interest but at  the speed and then im saved by a slow song stairway to heaven which is a classic makeout anthem led zeppelin eight minutes long whats great about slow dancing is you cant really mess it up cause its just sort of a slowmotion hug  the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it shed be  what are you doing and id be  i dont pick up on social cues  but its such a long song  stairway so im just trying not to fidget im sort of a fidgety person i feared if i fidgeted too much i might initiate the head tilt too early i didnt know anything about making out but id seen people do it i could see theres  a head tilt i had heard there were tongues involved and i could see that there was  some kind of space in between the two mouths to me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing what is happening in that space there is no  theres no video documentation of that area its  the giant squid of making out no one has seen it alive theyve only seen it washed up on the shore which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy but so im trying not to fidget then with   minutes left in stairway to heaven the song hits that crescendo all around me kids start to make the tilt just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me and i was  oh no i dont want to be alone anymore and i make the slightest tilt and then sandra comes in strong and then its an allout mouth war and she had artillery cause she had braces it was  a dog eating spaghetti and the fork as this oral atrocity is taking place all i can think is im not alone anymore im not in the nonmakeout club and all i wanted to do was tell my friends but i couldnt because up until that point id lied and said that id had my first kiss i walked off the dance floor sam was  howd it go dude i had to be  same as always pretty smooth as the week wore on i started to convince myself well maybe it did go well and i should call sandra and this could bud into a relationship of some kind but i got her number from tom and those conversations ended up being very brief  we didnt have a lot to talk about i remember just being  hey you  full house me neither cool all right later  what i mean at certain points i remember getting this vibe from he',\n",
              "  'r kind of  why are you calling me and i remember thinking oh im probably reading into that one too much and and then she stopped calling me back and i was  oh yeah i read into that one perfectly but i just felt so dumb about the whole thing and the worst part is i couldnt even tell my friends until one day i was i was standing by my locker with my friend tom and so i said to him i was  hey whats going on with sandra  she hasnt called me back and tom has this knowing grin on his face i was  what tom was  nothing and i was  what tom was  nothing and i was  what toms  oh i talked to sandra and she said youre the worst kisser shes ever kissed and it was so devastating cause not only was it probably true but i couldnt explain to my friends why it was true i couldnt say that makes sense ive never done that before so instead i had to play it off i had to be  yeah that sounds about right im a terrible kisser thats kind of my thing so i lean in to kiss jenny and she says oh no thank you she agrees to go out with me in new york we were both living in new york and she gave me her number and i typed it in my phone and from that point on she would be jen irish pub nice a few weeks later i took her out to a restaurant i couldnt afford to show her how much money i could put on my credit card were out to dinner and she says to me she goes everyone hates me at work and i said why would they hate you i love you she goes you love me i go i mean you seem cool i pulled it back i didnt want to show all my cards just about nine of them one of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said  sometimes ill date two people at once and that way im never let down by either person i said that seems  a really smart plan  id  to do that as well and she said im still kind of seeing my exboyfriend john and you can see other people too but you have to tell me if youre seeing them and i was  all right sounds  a plan got it break i got to go find some more people  and so a few nights later im in another city and i do a show and after the show i went out to a bar and i ended up making out with this random girl then a few nights later im out to dinner with jenny and she says how was your trip and i said it was great i did some shows and then one night i ended up making out with this random girl and that didnt go over very well in the conversation i could sense that something was wrong and i was  but im right about that right  im supposed to tell you if that happens right and she says yeah but it doesnt mean that i wont lose interest in you and i said thats a whole new clause thats a twist what is this the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects i said are you still seeing john and she said sometimes i said well dont you see the contradiction in that and she says yes and it gets very quiet because we were falling in love three weeks into my relationship with jenny i built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to bermuda i wanted to show her how much more money i could put on my credit card since i didnt have a lot left we went to bermuda cause it was the off season you can get these great deals online because as it turns out when its winter in new york it is also winter in bermuda and  jenny and i meet up at the airport and shes late which is a big pet peeve of mine i fancy myself as a professional traveler im always two hours early i have my pocket for my ticket and my passport and i have laceless moccasins i never tell jokes about bombs and and jennys late and then we get to security and im not making this up she doesnt have a license or a passport and i said what do you mean i go how do you travel and she goes well usually they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work id i dont  to dwell on the differences between men and women but i just cant imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport and they would let him on the plane but women get a pass on things  this that i find completely bewildering i mean if i were in charge of alqaeda for example what what i would do is i would recruit attractive women because theyre just not stopped under any circumstances although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the  virgins and  the women wouldnt want that unless theyre lesbians although theres an idea  alqaeda alqaeda could recruit hot lesbians although then theyd have to guarantee that the  virgins are also lesbians i mean what are the odds  all  virgins are also lesbians unless you think of sexuality as  a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity  the  virgins are  i didnt even know i was a lesbian until i had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist and now thats all im into i used to be into these afghani guys who are so crazy theyd die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me and  of my friends but now i dont see khalid in the same way anymore the point is we went to bermuda and were on the flight on the flight and the flight attendant comes over and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us and she says congratulations on your honeymoon and we said oh no thanks were not on our honeymoon and she walks away and jenny says thats so funny i dont think ill ever go on a honeymoon and i said oh really and she goes yeah i dont think id ever want to get married in my life and i said oh really i go me too i said is that based on a principle or ',\n",
              "  'did you have a bad relationship  what was your first boyfriend  and she told me about her first boyfriend brian it was they were at the same bus stop when they were  and they would make out on the bus and they were together for six years and they  their relationship got deeper and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together and i said then what and she said he died he had leukemia and i said well do you ever talk about this with anyone and she says no i dont really  to talk about it but these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where jenny was opening up to me and i was opening up to her and every night wed be up till  or  in the morning and we were so happy we at one point i was  well we should do this again we should go on another trip and you could get a license or a passport jenny said that sounds great but i dont think id get a license or a passport cause they dont make me get one and i was  yeah but its the law  jenny says yeah i dont think ill get one cause they dont make me get one  thats how i feel thats how jenny argues things sometimes shell just say thats how i feel and ill say thats not an argument  were not even in an argument right now because you dont have an argument and shell say i just won that argument and ill say thats not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is and shell say i just won that argument again thats how i feel you could see how this could be a little bit maddening   on our final day on the trip we got into an argument about essentially nothing she noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel and she said we should play and i was  yeah but not  a game and she said why and i said well cause id win and she said no i think i would win i go no i know that id win and i know that what im supposed to say is that the guy says ill win the girl says ill win and the guy lets her win and then she likes him more but i just dont have that in me and jenny goes you dont have to let me win lets go out and play and so we went out and played basketball and i just kicked her ass i mean it was just  it was just   to    to  i mean i was having a good day but still i was just destroying her and at one point she literally said ive never met someone whos so obsessed with the score and i said the score is what makes it a game so were arguing this over lunch and then again it comes up at dinner and then were still arguing about it at  or  in the morning about essentially nothing and she said i dont understand why youre so obsessed with being right i go im not obsessed with it i just am i said why do you think youre right and she says thats how i feel i said if you think im so wrong about everything why are you even with me and jenny says you cant choose who you love which is true but it doesnt mean its good i remember the first time i fell in love i was in high school and it was that first time where you fall in love and youre just  this is it i found her im  years old and im done  and her name was amanda and she was  adorable and funny and what was really exciting for me was that she was  a delinquent  i was  this playbytherules school citizen and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid which i thought was a really strong quality  at one point she was  it was totally messed up because it wasnt even me it was this other girl and i was framed and i was just  awesome  no one would ever frame me for anything i just i thought it was  an opposites attract situation she wanted to know what it was  to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper and i wanted to know what it was  to be cool at one point i was  do you want to write an article for the newspaper she goes i dont want to write an article i want to do things people write articles about and i was  good answeri find that when you fall in love you tend to overlook certain red flags one of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me but then she would pull it back shed be  no one likes you at all only kidding or  youre  a nerd but youre not even smart just joking cant choose who you lovesecond red flag with amanda was that she was a liar and i dont i dont mean that in an offensive way  lying was kind of  a its  a sport at the school i was at i transferred from the all boys school to this coed school there was this one guy in my class named keith robbins who was a legendary liar youd know when he was lying cause he would lick his finger  a bookie and he would dart his eyes from side to side and hed go yeah yeah nice nice  and he wasnt even handling money  i dont even know what this is about and then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant hed be  yeah my uncles tony robbins motivational speaker yeah nice  and we found out that that wasnt even true but even if that were true that wouldnt be impressive to a bunch of high school students but i think thats the jedi level of lying is you lie about little stuff and no one notices when youre lying about big stuff its  bankingthe final red flag with amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend i know im in the future also i think we can all see now cause were so smart and mikes so dumb and   i can also see in retrospect thats a much bigger red flag than i perceived it to be at the time but i was so excited she was even with me at all and she said she h',\n",
              "  'ad another boyfriend at home but they were in the process of breaking up but it was a bad time cause his parents were sick and so i tried to be understanding of that  i went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents and i thought well this is the affirmation that i need im gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend and i drive my moms station wagon to amandas parents house and i walk in the front door and theres amanda and theres her parents and its going well and a few hours go by and this other guy comes over to the house and his name is scott im assuming hes  a family friend or a relative and slowly im noticing similarities between scott and things that amanda has said about her other boyfriend theyre both in their first year in college and theyre competitive wrestlers and its dawning on me that im hanging out with my girlfriends boyfriend and its going pretty well i mean he he seemed  a nice guy i could totally see what she saw in him there was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom she would hold on to my hand and she would say i wish it were just you and me here and i remember thinking you could make that happen the way she said it was as though she werent involved in the decision process  id love to but the boys in corporatewell the day took an even stranger turn when scott suggested that we go hang out at his house and i met his parents it is indescribable meeting your girlfriends boyfriends parents for the first time part of you is angry for obvious reasons but then part of you still wants to make a good impression  youre  maybe if this goes well shell see that im good with adults in general as a side note his parents seemed in perfect health at one point his dad even said to me how do  amanda and i said were just friends from school and i was so ashamed and i felt so dumb and i drove home and i remember thinking i am never gonna let this happen to me again so ten months into my relationship with jenny she invites me to meet her parents and this was a tricky time at this point our relationship was intense but casual which is a dangerous relationship cocktail and it was a hard thing to organize cause i was away probably five days out of the week and so we found a sunday where i was coming back from a fiveday stint in texas which was awful cause it was in texas and i thats thats not to say i dislike texas entirely its such a large thing to dislike and  but that week it felt  texas just disliked me and i just kind of disliked texas back to the point where i developed a small drinking problem which is which is very popular in texas i was performing at a comedy club now comedy i love comedy clubs cause theyre sort of a highlow entertainment proposition  in some ways though theyre the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word and then some of them sell dildo straws   theres  bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends and theyre handing out gummy penises or whatever thats thats actually a thing i didnt even realize that i didnt realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was was the gummy quality of the penis i feel  if i were in charge of the candification of the penis it would be hard candy and then if and then if you suck it down to the gummy part then you just sort of put that off to the side but i but thats thats not my job im  i leave that to the experts but i just i just do the comedy part but i was performing at this club all week and after the late show saturday night i was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things and id been drinking all week and  i always try to be a team player  so i was  whatever i can do to help i dont see how this could end badly and  the next morning i wake up in the my hotel room and im hung over and im groggy and i roll out of bed and i run to the airport to catch my flight im still two hours early and i land in new york and i get a cab to jennys parents house and i walk in the front door and theres jenny and theres her parents and theres her other sort of exboyfriend john and he wasnt front and center  he was just kind of around  he was in the pool  wading and doing laps  that kind of thing but i pulled jenny aside i was  well whats john doing here and she says well he and i arent still together but when we were together he became friends with my stepdad and hes been staying here at their house the last couple weeks and i said  thats not good i feel  that gives him the edge jennys staring at me and i said what she says you have a hickey on your neck and i said i dont think thats true and then i glance at the mirror next to me and realize that in fact i do have a hickey on my neck and i say im really sorry and she says where is that from and i said there was this bachelorette party and i was drunk that sentence never comes out right i mean theres no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even  and we start arguing and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment i didnt have a leg to stand on i was  well what about john what was he doing there she said you have a hickey on your neck i said yeah but at least i told you the truth and she said eventually and i said eventually is better than never and then she kneed me in the balls i dont know if youve ever experienced this before im sure half of you hav',\n",
              "  'e not  its  being electrocuted except you dont get to die its  you want to die but you cant and theres a person in your face saying you deserve this which they wouldnt even do in electrocutions i think they would deem that as inhumane\\xa0 even in texasjenny says i think that we should just break up  its not just this i mean youre away a lot of the time and even when youre here you work at night and i work in the day i just dont think its gonna work out and i said \\xa0 and we were apart for about six months and i missed her so much but i kept resisting calling her cause i wanted to give her space and every once in a while id get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from jen irish pub nice and it would just say hi and id write back hi it was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another but i think in some ways kept us together and finally on new years i caved in and i called her i said hey i really miss you and i want to see you and we got together for coffee and we hit it off just  we used to and we decided we would get back together we had a great period there  i took her to get a license and a passport first we went for her social security card and then we took that to the dmv and then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport it was  the triple crown of identifications jenny was wildly identifiable one night she was heading back from my apartment to hers and she stops and i said what and she says i think that we should live together and i said no i really dont think thats a good idea  ive just decided  as a principle im not gonna get married or live with someone its not personal and she said well unless we live together i just dont think its gonna work out cause we just dont see each other enough and i dont think that we stand a chance thats how i feel so we moved in together and one day jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends and she invites me to come along and i said oh no thanks that doesnt go over so well she says why and i said well as  i dont believe in marriage and so i dont buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it she said well what do you believe in and i said i dont know she said well if you dont believe in anything how can you not believe in marriage and i said well first of all  it just doesnt seem necessary i mean is it  marriage is an archaic institution invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property i dont want to be a part of that second of all i dont even think we have a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is i mean one of me and andys friends was about to get engaged and we were skeptical and we said are you sure this is the person you want to be with for the rest of your life and he goes yeah i think so and we said well what if she gets in a car accident and shes disfigured would you stay with her then and he said maybe that is not an acceptable answer third of all if im so in love why does it need to be written into a government contract and im not one of these  i dont want government up in my business kind of people i think the government does a nice job delivering the mail and suggesting i dont eat poison but i just dont understand why they need to be involved in my personal relationships then finally if marriage is religious shouldnt i believe in the religion ive been to more weddings of my friends where the people on the altar dont believe in the religion of the church theyve invited us to some of them even go to classes with the priest in advance to more elaborately lie about believing in a religion they dont believe in just to have a wedding in a fancy building that is insane thats how i feel so i explain this to jenny and jenny says well if you ever did want to get married i would marry you and i said why arent you listening to any of this and jenny says thats how i feel at this point it was  in the morning wed been arguing all night and we hadnt slept i had to catch a flight at  am out of newark airport to los angeles for a show i was doing that night at this point im overtired and im angry and im late im stuffing my things in my roller suitcase and i walk out of our apartment its  am that part of the morning before the earth even exists before they program the matrix or whatever you walk out of your apartment part of the road isnt even there theres a guy with a laptop going we need a road stat whats the code for building tank  and i get to the airport the news hasnt even started yet its just an anchor looking around  what are you up to and i get to the kiosk and i print up my ticket and i bring it to the security lady and she looks at me and she goes well that aint your gate  i guess they changed the gate but the way she said it was as though i had participated in the decision of changing it i was  i was not involved in this process i wasnt even ccd  as though i had gone to the kiosk and been    hell im flying out of  and then i photoshopped my own ticket printed it out and been  this is where im going  im not that aggressive as a traveler so i was  well where is this gate she goes its in another terminal you got to take a tram she points to the tram and i start walking my roller suitcase and i hear her say and you better run  i guess i was late at that point so i started running and the roller suitcase does not enjoy running the roller suitcase was  i dont want to run i have wheels and i was  i dont want to r',\n",
              "  'un either but this is what we have to do i tell you what when we get to the hotel ill walk you in circles for a few hours then i i get to the tram and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives and it says zero minutes i was  perfect thats exactly how long i want to wait but the trams riding away i was  thats  minute then it says ten minutes and im experiencing that psychological downward spiral  oh great im gonna miss my flight and then im gonna miss every flight from now on and im gonna miss my family reunion and then im not gonna have a family and then im gonna be a crack whore and its  all of a sudden im a crack whore just because i miss this one flight i can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time andi get on the next tram ten minutes later and i run to the gate and im sweaty and im out of breath but im on time and im so relieved that i sit down in a chair at the gate and i fall asleep and i wake up to the sound of the door shutting i jump up and the door is closed and i am on the sad side of the door the happy side has an airplane and a pilot the sad side is me and the cinnabon lady normally id be very excited if it were just me and the cinnabon lady im a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year i think thats an effective use of time but in this instance i needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane and the cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community i was  do  these people she was  all i know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun i ran up to the giant glass window i started pounding on the window  in a romantic comedy i was  drew barrymores character come back she didnt come back and i missed my flight i got on the next one they could get me on there was a stopover in texas  how i feel about texas and  i get to los angeles late that night and id missed my show id never missed one of my shows before and im so angry and jennys calling me but im not picking up the phone cause im blaming this entire day on her i get back to my friend andys house and i said andy this relationship is messing up my entire life and andy goes youre right i go i know im right he goes yeah youre right i go i know im right i got to tell her about this in the morning i drive out of andys small road and im tboned thats the culinary way of describing it in   seconds im spun around and i think im dead no wait im paralyzed and then i hear nothing then i hear the other car skid out and drive away  minutes later im sitting on a curb at this point the police have arri have arrived as well as my friend andy and thats when i start crying  how when you drop a baby on the ground it doesnt doesnt start crying right away because it doesnt understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face and then its  oh i guess i should be doing something that matches that waah im crying because im looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that in that moment i might have ceased to exist  i said earlier i dont really believe in anything so in my mind that would have been the end of all things id experienced in my life every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion and the officer comes over and he says what happened and i said i got hit by this car and then i heard nothing and then i heard the other car skid out and drive away the officer points over to the light the other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree i cant help but think thats karma thats a hit and run and hit and then the officer puts this form in my face and he goes sign this and i said well what does it mean and he goes it means youre  and that we can leave i was really shaken up i was  i dont know if im  and he goes just sign it which is a very unattractive quality when someone just repeats a command that youve just said no to and its unattractive but very effective  i signed it andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution but we have to wait two hours cause the other driver had beat us there and eventually were with the doctor and andy says to him he goes well was the other guy drunk and the doctor says well i cant answer that and andy says was he he uses the technique we had learned earlier and it works  the doctor says well hes heading to jail now and andy and i flash each other a look  the hardy boys  case closed a few hours later were back at andys house its probably around  in the morning and i have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have neardeath experiences i say i need to call jenny and tell her that we need to get married and andy says mike sleep on it and i said no no no this makes perfect sense and i pick up my phone and i dial her number and he puts his hand over the phone and he says mike sleep on it he saves me the next morning i fly back to new york and a few weeks later i get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that i just described and it had found me at fault and that i owed and im not making this up  for the repairs on the other drivers mercedes suv and i was  well this cant be happening i explained to the woman i think its a misunderstanding the other guy was clearly drunk it was definitely not my fault and she said im really sorry but unless they change the accident report you owe this money so i requ',\n",
              "  'ested the accident report and im gonna show you the actual accident report tonight i dont know if youve ever seen one of these things before but its a little bit  homework for cops and officer timson not so good with the homework he consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two vehicle one and vehicle two at one point so badly that he says  thats me started to go but all of a sudden  thats me also came at a high rate of speed crashing into him now im pretty selfdestructive as a person but i would never crash into my own car with my own car nor would i understand how you could do that this part is even crazier the other drivers statement at the scene of the accident was i was on venice going  im not too sure i was going away from the beach i was driving i dont know what happened did i hurt anyone i dont know where i was going but i came from home i had a sip of beer which is really everyones favorite quantity of beer just the one sip right thats what they serve these days at the homebeachpubso all of its mine the officer makes one key mistake he checks the box that finds me at fault so im  i need to get officer timson on the phone so we can clear up this misunderstanding the problem is he keeps ducking my calls and i know cause im calling two or three times a day leaving messages calling departments next to his department so he knows im trying to reach him and finally after a month of this i get him on the phone and im so relieved and i explain this misunderstanding and he listens to me and he says do the right thing and pay for the guys car i know and i mean thats what i said i go arent you listening to any of this i go and this guy was clearly drunk i mean he nearly killed me inches from where he hit and i would be dead right now and he wants me to pay for his car dont you see how crazy that is just as one human being to another and he says do the right thing and pay for the guys car and he hangs up the phone and at this point this stops being about money and its just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law this is chinatown so i started printing up google maps of the scene of the accident and california state driving law im on the phone with lawyers and private investigators theres only one lawyer who would consider the case and he was an accident lawyer and he said did you have any loss of income from the accident and i said no and he says did you have any loss of income from the accident and i said no this isnt about money and he doesnt take the case and this is when i start going completely madim up to about  or  am every night just surfing the web i get a subscription to a site called netdetectivecom which is a great site for vigilantes who have  so now i know this guys name i know where he lives i know what he does for a living and in my mind it becomes  a trailer for a revenge thriller  jim bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this but jim bosworth had another thing coming mike birbiglia i was  im gonna track down jim bosworth im gonna sue jim bosworth and im gonna sue the entire los angeles police department at this point people stopped talking to me entirely my friends would call me  hey whats going on id be  ill tell you whats going on id tell them this whole story and theyd be  you should get a lawyer id be  this is way past lawyers a lawyer wouldnt even touch this cause he wouldntthe only person who would talk to me at this point was jenny one night we were out to dinner at a restaurant and shes talking to me but im not listening cause im writing down ideas i have for the case on my napkin ive drawn out a diagram of the intersection and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in the laws the other driver broke and the phone numbers im gonna call that week and im so angry im writing over my own handwriting to the point where im ripping through the napkin and jenny looks at me and she says what are you doing and i said well this is my case and she says well why dont you work on that in the morning and i said well which part of this napkin dont you understand jenny says mike youre right but its only hurting you and im just so glad that youre alive and i think that we should focus on that she only has to say it once and i give up the case and i pay for this guys car july   jenny and i went to city hall and got married i still didnt believe in the idea of marriage and i still dont but i believe in her and ive given up on the idea of being right thank you guys very much thank you thank you guys
